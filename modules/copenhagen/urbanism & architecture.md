#### Nationalmuseets Klunkelejlighed

Analysing a plan of the Christiansen house 
- An L shaped building, with a dining room as a circular room being the central element connecting the two sides of the home
- One side has the entertainment spaces, with living rooms, dining rooms, drawing, salon and study rooms, where guests would be entertained and 'impressed'
- The other side has the bedrooms (of the daughters and couple), and the maids' bedrooms
- The kitchen is pushed into the house, away from the entertainment spaces and closer to the maids; the bathroom and toilet are also pushed away
- Two staircases of different sizes and location, a smaller one in the back for the maids and a larger one in the front for the owners and guests
- **SIZE**
	- Different sizes of staircases, show the importance of who uses them
- **LOCATION**
	- Entertainment rooms are facing the front of the building, with a view on the canal
	- Bathroom and toilet located in the end of the house, near the maids
	- Kitchen is away from entertainment rooms, to keep smells away, near the maids
- Children: in the 1930s (??), children are recognised as having their own phase of life and are not just "small adults"; 
- The **bicycle** gave women a reason to dress in a way that allowed them to move (lol); so there is a relationship between the invention of the bicycle, and the women's liberation movement

#### lecture

A city is about density and encounters, which are embodied by [[world exhibitions]]. In 1851, the first world fair took place in the **Crystal Palace**, in London, a building which represented modernity.
It uses steel, glass, curtain walls (steel frames on which windows and glass facades hang, which replace massive walls). 

Worlds fairs can be looked at from multiple perspectives:
- *Economy*:  Karl Marx wrote his manifesto and Das Kapital at the time of the first expo, which he describes as "a gigantic accumulation of commodities" - Das Kapital. 
	- They were a demonstration of the power of industrialisation, to see new technologies and what machines could produce
	- An era of [[competition]], which would enhance the development of society; 'peaceful competition' replaces wars
	- The entire world is a [[market]] with a [[growth]] mindset; this is the beginning of [[globalisation]]
- *Politics*: a demonstration of nationalism, showing the world how developed your society and nation was. 'Peaceful competition' replaces wars, and progress replaces revolution. 
- *Shopping*: becomes popular, 'Au Bonheur des Dames' style 
- *Psychology*: overwhelmed by objects and things to look at
- *Architecture*: iconic buildings (in scale and materials) like Guggenheim Bilbao Museum/Opera house in Sydney. These buildings have **visual power**  and stand out. This is the same for Crystal Palace and the national pavillions, the Eiffel Tower...
	- Effects of using steel and glass: creating lightness, curtain walls,...
- *Art*: new forms of perceptions

**Colonial exhibitions**: expos were taking place at a timy of imperialism and colonialism, shows with aspects from the colonies were put on (eg. elephants).

Expos were modernising cities, for example in Paris through Hausmannisation.
  
From a world within a building, to a world within a city; a modern fairy tale, from HC Andersen *The Dryads* - you find yourself in Paris at the world exhibition

Aesthetics is about **scale reduction** (?)

## readings

#### Elizabeth Wilson, *The Rhetoric of Urban Space*, 1995
- Talks about Jameson's postmodernism, "Postmodernism and The Cutlural Logic of Late Capitalism", where in [[postmodernism]] you are lost in a sense-less urban space with no center, the suburbs blend into endless same-ness, where places like Silicon Valley are ugly places empty of any soul
- **Private spaces**
	- The 'new indurstrial city' of the 21st century has created private spaces "as a refuge from public dirt and squalor" (p. 149). Instead of upgrading public space to be desirable, we privatise what is nice to keep away from others who might degrade our experience
	- Talks about embellishing the private sphere for *women*, how [[garden cities]] were made to "improve the domestic environment, and did assume that women's primary role would be domestic" (p. 149)
- **Women in public spaces**
	- Women were always guarded, esp. young and unmarried middle-class women who didn't work; in the 19th century, when "patriarchal control" loosened, planners desired consumerist ways to entertain women and "provide more and more seductions" in the shape of exhibitions, department stores, refreshment rooms
	- Interestingly, these consumerist places with dedicated spots for women to interact and spend time *liberated* middle-class women and gave them a space to go, unaccompanied by male figures
	- Still, women (working class and other) could not enter the job market on the same terms as men
	- "Unnerved at the sight of a new, rough, rban female proletariat throughing the streets..." (p. 150)
- **Anti-urban ideology** int he 19th century was centered around the fear of losing patriarchal control over women, and there was a desire to return the control of the household to the man; this did not work (women's emancipation continued, even if it is still not fulfilled); women were seen as a central *problem*
- Women experience urban space differently from men - they do not feel as safe, and thus look out for themselves and each other. This has the effect that men are more like to be *assaulted* in the streets, and women abused in the privacy of the domestic sphere
- **Richard Sennett**
- ==**Dystopian rhetoric** of Jameson, re-postmodernism==, people are living in an inner city "fraught with danger and horror", amongst prostitutes and drunks, making the city dangerous (but tentalising and intriguing?); in movies, the hero is the suburban male who rescues the young woman from the debaucherie of the city
- Florence was planned to be turned into a complete museum (?!! dystopian postmodernism!!) and residents moved to a nearby town for the closign off and reconstruction of Florence; fortunately this never happened
- **Post urban spaces**: talks about museums being the same as consumerist spaces/malls, where the final stop is the shop or cafe attached. The V&A's 1980s ad read "*an ace caff with a rather good museum attached*"
- **Consumerisation of space**: similarly to museums, Wilson says that airports are increasingly indistinguishable from malls; massively *consumerised* urban spaces are stripping cities of [[diversity]] and breeding [[uniformity]]
	- If you do not have "the passport of money" you are increasingly excluded from urban life, you are an "underclass" or even an "unclass"; malls exclude beggars and the homeless, so the middle upper classes can have a 'pleasant' experience undisturbed by these other people --> **invisibility** of the social ills of the city, deresponsibilises people, creates distance between classes, raises inequality. Think about the homeless and drug problem in SF, and the wealthy residents, engineers and googlers turning a blind eye and just 'ignoring' the problematic spaces
- **Invisibility** is a "crucial feature of modern inequality" (p. 158), where those in the suburbs/banlieues and out of sight of the wealthy inner-city residents, they are looking in 
	- Characterising people are visible/invisible, goes back to the divide of the **public and private**, which is eroded by technology entering the home and advertising the rest of the world that is up for consumption
	- And interesting that "public life" takes places in privately owned property and buildings (eg. malls), and publicly-owned does not mean there is public access (eg. municipal housing)

#### mÃ¸ller, *the Parks of copenhagen 1850-1900*, 2010
- Because parks do not generate any income, in cities where land prices are so high, why did city planners build parks at all?
- The parks were built in the 1800s, after fires and wars destroyed the city and the medieval walls were no longer relevant. A movement considered dirty air as transmitting diseases (the theory of *miasma*) and thus clean-smelling, fresh air was regarded as healthy. Plus, cholera epidemics and the Public Health Act (1848) encouraged clean, open air spaces for recreation and exercise; plus, overcrowding was starting to become a problem - the population grew fast between 1850-1880, from 150k to 235k
- Research into air quality revealed that decomposing organic matter, high levels of CO2, methane, nitrogen, were high in neighbourhoods with high mortality rates
- To remedy the density and deaths from poor hygiene and air conditions, multiple ideas were brought forward by politicians, planners, thinkers:
	- gardens as wide open spaces
	- boulevards as large corridors for ventilation, with seaside parks
	- a combination of squares, parks, streets, to resemble a "full pulmonary organs of a living creature" (p. 115)
- *Demarcation line* --> where is this?? they mention it as like a line where the city... starts? stops? where the city walls were? the old defense wall? 
- Ferdinand Meldahl proposed the plan to transform the old defence walls into a park
- The Sanitary Movement lasted until 1870s; when bacteriology was becoming more accepted, the argument that parks were necessary for public health didn't stand, moreover cholera was shown to spread through contaminated sewers (water) and not through bad ventilation (air) (although this doesn't mean that bad ventilation is not harmful). Miamism was eventually ruled out after the end of the last cholera epidemic in the 1880s
- in the 1900s, public parks were still perceived as essential to public health but for other reasons than clean air - for physical exercise and sports


- Regimes
	- Until 1848: absolutist regime
