## notes

### urban planning in copenhagen

#### the planner

**19th century**: begin to see the contours of this new figure, the '[[planner]]'.  There is a new, widespread "belief in planning as an overall principle for ordering human affairs" (Ward, 1994). 

The planner is there to "create new settlement forms, and perhaps to destroy the old, without interference or question" (Hall and Twedwr Jones).

**20th century**: planning enters as a profession and in academies, and is not only an improvised practice. Plans must be *big* and aim high, a jump in scale; planners work on xl-xxl scales

[[Le Corbusier]]: "without plan we have the sensation, so insupportable to man, of shapelessness, of disorder, of willfulness" (1923).
- His Radiant City plan: buldose Paris and create a new city from scratch ('[[tabula rasa]]')

Planners were
- **Military** men (medieval, 1500s): first city planning was for fortification; military created walls, strategically designed the best ways to protect the city
- **Medical** men (mid-1800s): planning for epidemics like cholera, density and crowdedness recognised as a public health issue. The cities were overpopulated because of the city walls preventing the spread, and encouraging density. 
	- Need to create 'better air', which becomes a class symbol - well to-do classes were the first to choose to live in healthy surroundings.
	- Still, there are socially conscious doctors (in Copenhagen) who realised they could not let this 'slumming' to happen, where the lower classes suffer from bad air quality
- **Engineers** (end 1800s): focus not only on beauty, but on *[[function]]*. eg. the Eiffel Tower is the epitome of the engineer as the planner
- **Architects**


Planner as [[communication|communicator]]

Planning trends in history
- **Middle ages**: "the supreme science of governing a city is rhetoric"
- **[[modernism|Modernity]]**: it isn't enough, or isn't the only way, to produce architecture through plans. As an architect (or planner) you must be able to write and argue your design, such that others understand and appropriate your design
- **Post-modernity**: the work of an architect isn't to draw, but to *write*

Planning and the public
- Pre-modern times: planning was a hidden practice done by the military. In this scenario you do not want to share plans, in order to protect your city
- Modernity (19th-20th century): cities are no longer fortified and controlled by a kingdom, medieval city walls are torn down
	- Cities for industries and citizens. There is a *democratisation* of the city, the *public enters the discussion*
- Increasing participation of the public in planning, private/public communication

####  the planning

Rise of urban planning (1860s)
- "Down with walls": in Barcelona, people had come to despise the walls encircling the city. Ildefonso Cerda comes up with a "theory of urbanisation", with ideas to eg. destruct the walls
- Cerda recognises the importance of the railroads and the masses moving across/in-out of the city through the city gates, in narrow streets, looking/going to work or home in the small dense city - recognises that nothing has been planned to *accomodate* the rapidly growing population

The concept of urban planning
- Cerda (Spanish): make the city a place where the engineer would create zoning, make circulation possible
- Camillo Sitte (Viennese): critique of the new Ringstrasse, with squares that are too large, boulevard too wide, letting too much wind. We need to create a city that returns to the Renaissance ([[human scale|human]]?) scales


Challenges: the nature of planning, there are problems that planners must find solutions for
- **External enemies**: outsiders who wanted to invade
- **Internal enemies**: crowding, classes; urban planning is class planning, making a place liveable for certain classes (ref. [[Friedrich Engels]]'s text on Manchester, Carl Schorske on Vienna); 
- **Hygiene**: epidemics like cholera
- **Traffic**: becomes a major challenge in planning with trains, cars, motorcycles, bikes; traffic is the 'great power of today', 
- **Preservation** of the old city: planners must have the sensibility to determine what is worth preserving
- Links between **old and new** city
- **Greenery and parks**: [[sustainability]], adding green in the city center
- **Scales**: ref. Koolhaas SMLXL

Interprative frames:
- The city should be like a *house*, and a house should be like a city (Alberti)
- The city is like a *machine* ([[Le Corbusier]]'s machine metaphore, "the house is a machine for living in")
- The city is like a *museum* (Aldo Rossi)
- The city is like a *theatre* (Lewis Mumford; encounters in public space are theatrical, there is front and backstage behaviours)
- The city is like a *body* (lungs, arteries, health; city hall square (Radhusplads) as the heart of the city; Chicago School?)
- The city is like a *book* (l'encyclopedie des Lumières, the city as a materialised encycloppedia)
- The city is like a *jungle*
- The city is like a *gambling machine* (production of experiences, the experienced city introduced by Florida, 'vibrancy')

Goals 
- Protection
- Production (industry, capital)
- Preservation (of space or ideals)
- Self reflection
- Health (eg. Howard's garden city ideal)
- Ciculation
- Legibility (ref. Kevin Lunch 'the image of the city')
- Experiences (Richard Florida, 'vibrancy' of the city)
- Entertainment (eg. Disneyland, city as an entertainment machine; post-modernism)

**Broadacre City** 
- Contrary to Le Corbusier's vertical, high-rise cities with 20+ level buildings, Lloyd Wright's broadacre city is a horizontal concept, with open highways dominating the city
- Both recognise the *car* as the protagonist of the modern city, a dominating figure
- "horizontality is the true line of human freedom on earth", with the car making this ideal possible; free movement across space

**[[Robert Moses]] vs [[Jane Jacobs]]**
- Moses: necessary to use a 'meat axe' to buldose through the city and make way for car lanes
- Opposed by Jacobs, who organised demonstrations against Moses

**Situationists**
- A movement where the city was seen not as one totality, not one machine, but a *patchwork* of different situations, where the *mind* is more important than the *material world* 
- Introduced the idea of psycho-geography, with improvised tours in the city that do not follow a straight line but follows desires


#### trends in the history of urban planning

- Modernisation and planning: Ildefonso Cerda
- Conservatism: Camillo Sitte (fond of 'crooked lines' as a break from monotonous areas of the modern city)
- Utopianism: Ebenezer Howard (garden city)
- Futurism: Sant Elia
- Modernism: Otto Wagner, Le Corbusier
- From universalism to individualism: Jane Jacobs, Kevin Lynch (using mental maps to understand how people read the city), George Cullen, Jan Gehl (life *between* buildings is more important than what is *in* the buildings)
- New urbanism: need to emphasise squares, streets, houses (the [[human scale]]), as the center of planning, using classic elements of city building
- Postmodernism
- Generic city: Koolhaas
- Cultural planning: Richard Florida, the Bilbao effect (using culture as a catalyst for urban development)

## seminars

### seminar 1

#### Nationalmuseets Klunkelejlighed

Analysing a plan of the Christiansen house 
- An L shaped building, with a dining room as a circular room being the central element connecting the two sides of the home
- One side has the entertainment spaces, with living rooms, dining rooms, drawing, salon and study rooms, where guests would be entertained and 'impressed'
- The other side has the bedrooms (of the daughters and couple), and the maids' bedrooms
- The kitchen is pushed into the house, away from the entertainment spaces and closer to the maids; the bathroom and toilet are also pushed away
- Two staircases of different sizes and location, a smaller one in the back for the maids and a larger one in the front for the owners and guests
- **SIZE**
	- Different sizes of staircases, show the importance of who uses them
- **LOCATION**
	- Entertainment rooms are facing the front of the building, with a view on the canal
	- Bathroom and toilet located in the end of the house, near the maids
	- Kitchen is away from entertainment rooms, to keep smells away, near the maids
- Children: in the 1930s (??), children are recognised as having their own phase of life and are not just "small adults"; 
- The **bicycle** gave women a reason to dress in a way that allowed them to move (lol); so there is a relationship between the invention of the bicycle, and the women's liberation movement

#### seminar lecture

A city is about density and encounters, which are embodied by [[world exhibitions]]. In 1851, the first world fair took place in the **Crystal Palace**, in London, a building which represented modernity.
It uses steel, glass, curtain walls (steel frames on which windows and glass facades hang, which replace massive walls). 

Worlds fairs can be looked at from multiple perspectives:
- *Economy*:  Karl Marx wrote his manifesto and Das Kapital at the time of the first expo, which he describes as "a gigantic accumulation of commodities" - Das Kapital. 
	- They were a demonstration of the power of industrialisation, to see new technologies and what machines could produce
	- An era of [[competition]], which would enhance the development of society; 'peaceful competition' replaces wars
	- The entire world is a [[market]] with a [[growth]] mindset; this is the beginning of [[globalisation]]
- *Politics*: a demonstration of nationalism, showing the world how developed your society and nation was. 'Peaceful competition' replaces wars, and progress replaces revolution. 
- *Shopping*: becomes popular, 'Au Bonheur des Dames' style 
- *Psychology*: overwhelmed by objects and things to look at
- *Architecture*: iconic buildings (in scale and materials) like Guggenheim Bilbao Museum/Opera house in Sydney. These buildings have **visual power**  and stand out. This is the same for Crystal Palace and the national pavillions, the Eiffel Tower...
	- Effects of using steel and glass: creating lightness, curtain walls,...
- *Art*: new forms of perceptions

**Colonial exhibitions**: expos were taking place at a timy of imperialism and colonialism, shows with aspects from the colonies were put on (eg. elephants).

Expos were modernising cities, for example in Paris through Hausmannisation.
  
From a world within a building, to a world within a city; a modern fairy tale, from HC Andersen *The Dryads* - you find yourself in Paris at the world exhibition

Aesthetics is about **scale reduction** (?)

## readings

#### elizabeth wilson, *The Rhetoric of Urban Space*, 1995
- Talks about Jameson's postmodernism, "Postmodernism and The Cutlural Logic of Late Capitalism", where in [[postmodernism]] you are lost in a sense-less urban space with no center, the suburbs blend into endless same-ness, where places like Silicon Valley are ugly places empty of any soul
- **Private spaces**
	- The 'new indurstrial city' of the 21st century has created private spaces "as a refuge from public dirt and squalor" (p. 149). Instead of upgrading public space to be desirable, we privatise what is nice to keep away from others who might degrade our experience
	- Talks about embellishing the private sphere for *women*, how [[garden cities]] were made to "improve the domestic environment, and did assume that women's primary role would be domestic" (p. 149)
- **Women in public spaces**
	- Women were always guarded, esp. young and unmarried middle-class women who didn't work; in the 19th century, when "patriarchal control" loosened, planners desired consumerist ways to entertain women and "provide more and more seductions" in the shape of exhibitions, department stores, refreshment rooms
	- Interestingly, these consumerist places with dedicated spots for women to interact and spend time *liberated* middle-class women and gave them a space to go, unaccompanied by male figures
	- Still, women (working class and other) could not enter the job market on the same terms as men
	- "Unnerved at the sight of a new, rough, rban female proletariat throughing the streets..." (p. 150)
- **Anti-urban ideology** int he 19th century was centered around the fear of losing patriarchal control over women, and there was a desire to return the control of the household to the man; this did not work (women's emancipation continued, even if it is still not fulfilled); women were seen as a central *problem*
- Women experience urban space differently from men - they do not feel as safe, and thus look out for themselves and each other. This has the effect that men are more like to be *assaulted* in the streets, and women abused in the privacy of the domestic sphere
- **Richard Sennett**
- ==**Dystopian rhetoric** of Jameson, re-postmodernism==, people are living in an inner city "fraught with danger and horror", amongst prostitutes and drunks, making the city dangerous (but tentalising and intriguing?); in movies, the hero is the suburban male who rescues the young woman from the debaucherie of the city
- Florence was planned to be turned into a complete museum (?!! dystopian postmodernism!!) and residents moved to a nearby town for the closign off and reconstruction of Florence; fortunately this never happened
- **Post urban spaces**: talks about museums being the same as consumerist spaces/malls, where the final stop is the shop or cafe attached. The V&A's 1980s ad read "*an ace caff with a rather good museum attached*"
- **Consumerisation of space**: similarly to museums, Wilson says that airports are increasingly indistinguishable from malls; massively *consumerised* urban spaces are stripping cities of [[diversity]] and breeding [[uniformity]]
	- If you do not have "the passport of money" you are increasingly excluded from urban life, you are an "underclass" or even an "unclass"; malls exclude beggars and the homeless, so the middle upper classes can have a 'pleasant' experience undisturbed by these other people --> **invisibility** of the social ills of the city, deresponsibilises people, creates distance between classes, raises inequality. Think about the homeless and drug problem in SF, and the wealthy residents, engineers and googlers turning a blind eye and just 'ignoring' the problematic spaces
- **Invisibility** is a "crucial feature of modern inequality" (p. 158), where those in the suburbs/banlieues and out of sight of the wealthy inner-city residents, they are looking in 
	- Characterising people are visible/invisible, goes back to the divide of the **public and private**, which is eroded by technology entering the home and advertising the rest of the world that is up for consumption
	- And interesting that "public life" takes places in privately owned property and buildings (eg. malls), and publicly-owned does not mean there is public access (eg. municipal housing)

#### møller, *the parks of copenhagen 1850-1900*, 2010
- Because parks do not generate any income, in cities where land prices are so high, why did city planners build parks at all?
- The parks were built in the 1800s, after fires and wars destroyed the city and the medieval walls were no longer relevant. A movement considered dirty air as transmitting diseases (the theory of *miasma*) and thus clean-smelling, fresh air was regarded as healthy. Plus, cholera epidemics and the Public Health Act (1848) encouraged clean, open air spaces for recreation and exercise; plus, overcrowding was starting to become a problem - the population grew fast between 1850-1880, from 150k to 235k
- Research into air quality revealed that decomposing organic matter, high levels of CO2, methane, nitrogen, were high in neighbourhoods with high mortality rates
- To remedy the density and deaths from poor hygiene and air conditions, multiple ideas were brought forward by politicians, planners, thinkers:
	- gardens as wide open spaces
	- boulevards as large corridors for ventilation, with seaside parks
	- a combination of squares, parks, streets, to resemble a "full pulmonary organs of a living creature" (p. 115)
- *Demarcation line* --> where is this?? they mention it as like a line where the city... starts? stops? where the city walls were? the old defense wall? 
- Ferdinand Meldahl proposed the plan to transform the old defence walls into a park
- The Sanitary Movement lasted until 1870s; when bacteriology was becoming more accepted, the argument that parks were necessary for public health didn't stand, moreover cholera was shown to spread through contaminated sewers (water) and not through bad ventilation (air) (although this doesn't mean that bad ventilation is not harmful). Miamism was eventually ruled out after the end of the last cholera epidemic in the 1880s
- in the 1900s, public parks were still perceived as essential to public health but for other reasons than clean air - for physical exercise and sports


- Regimes
	- Until 1848: absolutist regime
	- 1848: constitutional monarchy

#### larsson and thomassen, *urban planning in denmark*
- 

#### kvorning, *copenhagen, formation, change and urban life*
- Recap of Copenhagen's urban planning and development, including urban structural typologies and building typologies. Reminiscent of the planning stages in [[principles of planning and urbanism]]!
- **Formation**
	- City and landscape (rural?) are in a [[dialectic]] relationship, push and pull; the city 'eradicates' the landscape, and 'absorbs' it in built-up form
	- Copenhagen was a [[fortified city]], with a strong military presence. Its medieval walls were doubly protected by Christianshavn, reclaimed land serving as a military base for protection (circa 1500?)
	- Water was a key feature of the city, encircling it, and determining the logic of the city's growth
	- Growth was *slow*: there was a lot of reclaimed, empty land for development but these areas were sparsely developed; "slowness became a characteristic feature in the process of Copenhagen's growth"
	- A Renaissance to Baroque to Industrial phase (p. 117)
		- Renaissance: "an abstract, preconceived ideal based on straight streets and a simple geometrical order"
		- Baroque: "a highly developed hierarchisation, ordered systems based on great organising axes culminating at their point of intersection"
	- 19th century
		- Development of suburbs, of "summer residences mainly for the wealthy (in the north of Cph)... the king's summer palace"  (p. 119)
		- Development similar to the [[Ringstrasse]], with monumental developments, catering to the social and cultural aspirations and trends of the (new) middle class: eg. Botanical Gardens "a combination of promenade and education"
	- Early 20th century
		- Increasing involvement of the state in urban planning
		- [[Social Democratic]] influences and the welfare state
			- Post-1930s housing crisis: emphasis on building social housing (with courtyards), gardens, kindergardens and child care...
			- "Danish brick"
			- "The good home with easy access to green spaces, with good new schools for the children, with the first creches, kindergartens and after-school insitutions, with common facilities for residents and with small local shops placed in various apartment buildings or in small local shopping centers formulated what is still today *the immediately appealing Social Democratic vision of a new future for the Danish worker - on the way to the [[welfare state]]*" (p. 122)
			- Increasing prosperity and industrialisation, as well as standardisation, make it possible for the [[working class]] to purchase homes
		- Mid-20th century
			- Regional planning and the [[fingerplan]] arrive
			- The car shapes regional planning, residentials areas do not have to be situated near a train station. New planning regulations are put in place to control development
		- 1980s
			- Focus goes away from the suburbs and returns to the city center, "to the classical city and classical urban life"
- **Change**
	- Change is about the *additions* that are made to the city in a new context, and the *departures* from existing forms --> dialectic relationship between the past and future
	- "*For a period after its formation a district functions and develops in accordance with the ideas and needs on which it was based - it is inhabited by people who have the same ideas as those inscribed in the structure and expression of the district. But at some point the tension between the original needs and new needs becomes so great that the district breaks up*" (p. 125)

#### bloom, *superkilen: participatory park extreme!*
- tlrd; Superkilen is supposed to represent the 'super'-diversity of the neighbourhood it is embedded in, Nørrebro. In a playful colour palette, with curiosities from around the world (from a trash can to a playground or bike parking), the park's narrative at home and internationally is about diversity and integration. 
	- *'A big part of understanding Superkilen comes from online narratives or by using a smart phoen to decipher hidden park narratives'*
	- However, its design from the start goes against the very principles it claims to uphold.
	- No resident was consulted during the design of the park (no participation, no democracy), although *"Copenhagen wants to brand itself as a palce where the government and its people go hand in hand in making the city"*
	- It is of poor quality, with plaques going missing and not being replaced, or the indoor flooring not being suitable for outdoors and being actually dangerous
	- it is awkward, with many things that "do not sit comfortably together", with bike racks in places people would not park bikes, with benches facing a way people do not want to face
	- It isn't suited to Denmark's climate and is an insult to enviromentalism and ecological concerns, eg. the red maples from China are not thriving and are growing fungus
	- The soil uprooted from from the Ghaza strip and placed in Copenhagen is a violent theft from Palestine
	- "*I am curious to know how diversity and integration are achieved with this park. What does it mean that a bunch of white people are making representations of diversity without really including the people they  are making them about except in perfunctory roles? Does it work by getting "the diverse people" to identify with inanimate objects from around the world, many of whicch were broken shortly after being put out?*" (p. 8) **diversity washing!**
- **Public space** and life being increasingly controlled by **private enterprise** as public spending is reduced
	- Realdania is the 'democratically run', 'philanthropic' business funding the park
	- Branding the project with "[[public participation]] as the driving force of the design leading towards the maximum freedom of expression" but in reality no one was consulted, or only a select few individuals
	- *"one way we can recognise that we are living in a neoliberal society is when corporations, high finance, and non-elected organisations and individuals start having an outsized role in shaping public life"* (p. 13)
- Space dictates how one ought to behave, *"spacial configurations naturalize social relations by transforming contingent forms into a permanent landscape that appears as immutable rather than open to contestation. By providing a shared background, spatial forms serve the function of integrating individuals into a shared conception of reality"* (p. 4)
	- when you enter a space, you recognise, or feel, how you are supposed to behave (eg. school vs. train ticket office), and not behaving as expected or desired by othes will engender consequences
- Theory of [[governmentality]] , or the art of governing, is the power that an authority uses to exert control over its population, on all scales
	- The park is heavily controlled, with graffiti being removed within 24h. This is a strong contrast to the reality in the nearby streets, where "*the city seems to stop caring*"
- Norrebro as a particular neighbourhood, from gang violence to gentrification. Multiple stories of grassroots plans for parks, and push against cafes gentrifying the neighbourhood
- City signs always show a *"sterile space"*, where dirt, homelessness, elderly and disabled, trash and can collecters are out of view

#### daniela sandler, *incarnate politics: the rhetorics of german reunification in the architecture of berlin*
- tldr
