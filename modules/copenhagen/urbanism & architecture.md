## notes

## INTRO

A city is about density and encounters, which are embodied by [[world exhibitions]]. In 1851, the first world fair took place in the **Crystal Palace**, in London, a building which represented modernity.
It uses steel, glass, curtain walls (steel frames on which windows and glass facades hang, which replace massive walls). 

Worlds fairs can be looked at from multiple perspectives:
- *Economy*:  Karl Marx wrote his manifesto and Das Kapital at the time of the first expo, which he describes as "a gigantic accumulation of commodities" - Das Kapital. 
	- They were a demonstration of the power of industrialisation, to see new technologies and what machines could produce
	- An era of [[competition]], which would enhance the development of society; 'peaceful competition' replaces wars
	- The entire world is a [[market]] with a [[growth]] mindset; this is the beginning of [[globalisation]]
- *Politics*: a demonstration of nationalism, showing the world how developed your society and nation was. 'Peaceful competition' replaces wars, and progress replaces revolution. 
- *Shopping*: becomes popular, 'Au Bonheur des Dames' style 
- *Psychology*: overwhelmed by objects and things to look at
- *Architecture*: iconic buildings (in scale and materials) like Guggenheim Bilbao Museum/Opera house in Sydney. These buildings have **visual power**  and stand out. This is the same for Crystal Palace and the national pavillions, the Eiffel Tower...
	- Effects of using steel and glass: creating lightness, curtain walls,...
- *Art*: new forms of perceptions

**Colonial exhibitions**: expos were taking place at a timy of imperialism and colonialism, shows with aspects from the colonies were put on (eg. elephants).

Expos were modernising cities, for example in Paris through Hausmannisation.
  
From a world within a building, to a world within a city; a modern fairy tale, from HC Andersen *The Dryads* - you find yourself in Paris at the world exhibition

Aesthetics is about **scale reduction** (?)

## URBAN PLANNING IN COPENHAGEN

#### the planner

**19th century**: begin to see the contours of this new figure, the '[[planner]]'.  There is a new, widespread "belief in planning as an overall principle for ordering human affairs" (Ward, 1994). 

The planner is there to "create new settlement forms, and perhaps to destroy the old, without interference or question" (Hall and Twedwr Jones).

**20th century**: planning enters as a profession and in academies, and is not only an improvised practice. Plans must be *big* and aim high, a jump in scale; planners work on xl-xxl scales

[[Le Corbusier]]: "without plan we have the sensation, so insupportable to man, of shapelessness, of disorder, of willfulness" (1923).
- His Radiant City plan: buldose Paris and create a new city from scratch ('[[tabula rasa]]')

Planners were
- **Military** men (medieval, 1500s): first city planning was for fortification; military created walls, strategically designed the best ways to protect the city
- **Medical** men (mid-1800s): planning for epidemics like cholera, density and crowdedness recognised as a public health issue. The cities were overpopulated because of the city walls preventing the spread, and encouraging density. 
	- Need to create 'better air', which becomes a class symbol - well to-do classes were the first to choose to live in healthy surroundings.
	- Still, there are socially conscious doctors (in Copenhagen) who realised they could not let this 'slumming' to happen, where the lower classes suffer from bad air quality
- **Engineers** (end 1800s): focus not only on beauty, but on *[[function]]*. eg. the Eiffel Tower is the epitome of the engineer as the planner
- **Architects**


Planner as [[communication|communicator]]

Planning trends in history
- **Middle ages**: "the supreme science of governing a city is rhetoric"
- **[[modernism|Modernity]]**: it isn't enough, or isn't the only way, to produce architecture through plans. As an architect (or planner) you must be able to write and argue your design, such that others understand and appropriate your design
- **Post-modernity**: the work of an architect isn't to draw, but to *write*

Planning and the public
- Pre-modern times: planning was a hidden practice done by the military. In this scenario you do not want to share plans, in order to protect your city
- Modernity (19th-20th century): cities are no longer fortified and controlled by a kingdom, medieval city walls are torn down
	- Cities for industries and citizens. There is a *democratisation* of the city, the *public enters the discussion*
- Increasing participation of the public in planning, private/public communication

####  the planning

Rise of urban planning (1860s)
- "Down with walls": in Barcelona, people had come to despise the walls encircling the city. Ildefonso Cerda comes up with a "theory of urbanisation", with ideas to eg. destruct the walls
- Cerda recognises the importance of the railroads and the masses moving across/in-out of the city through the city gates, in narrow streets, looking/going to work or home in the small dense city - recognises that nothing has been planned to *accomodate* the rapidly growing population

The concept of urban planning
- Cerda (Spanish): make the city a place where the engineer would create zoning, make circulation possible
- Camillo Sitte (Viennese): critique of the new Ringstrasse, with squares that are too large, boulevard too wide, letting too much wind. We need to create a city that returns to the Renaissance ([[human scale|human]]?) scales


Challenges: the nature of planning, there are problems that planners must find solutions for
- **External enemies**: outsiders who wanted to invade
- **Internal enemies**: crowding, classes; urban planning is class planning, making a place liveable for certain classes (ref. [[Friedrich Engels]]'s text on Manchester, Carl Schorske on Vienna); 
- **Hygiene**: epidemics like cholera
- **Traffic**: becomes a major challenge in planning with trains, cars, motorcycles, bikes; traffic is the 'great power of today', 
- **Preservation** of the old city: planners must have the sensibility to determine what is worth preserving
- Links between **old and new** city
- **Greenery and parks**: [[sustainability]], adding green in the city center
- **Scales**: ref. Koolhaas SMLXL

Interprative frames:
- The city should be like a *house*, and a house should be like a city (Alberti)
- The city is like a *machine* ([[Le Corbusier]]'s machine metaphore, "the house is a machine for living in")
- The city is like a *museum* (Aldo Rossi)
- The city is like a *theatre* (Lewis Mumford; encounters in public space are theatrical, there is front and backstage behaviours)
- The city is like a *body* (lungs, arteries, health; city hall square (Radhusplads) as the heart of the city; Chicago School?)
- The city is like a *book* (l'encyclopedie des Lumières, the city as a materialised encycloppedia)
- The city is like a *jungle*
- The city is like a *gambling machine* (production of experiences, the experienced city introduced by Florida, 'vibrancy')

Goals 
- Protection
- Production (industry, capital)
- Preservation (of space or ideals)
- Self reflection
- Health (eg. Howard's garden city ideal)
- Ciculation
- Legibility (ref. Kevin Lunch 'the image of the city')
- Experiences (Richard Florida, 'vibrancy' of the city)
- Entertainment (eg. Disneyland, city as an entertainment machine; post-modernism)

**Broadacre City** 
- Contrary to Le Corbusier's vertical, high-rise cities with 20+ level buildings, Lloyd Wright's broadacre city is a horizontal concept, with open highways dominating the city
- Both recognise the *car* as the protagonist of the modern city, a dominating figure
- "horizontality is the true line of human freedom on earth", with the car making this ideal possible; free movement across space

**[[Robert Moses]] vs [[Jane Jacobs]]**
- Moses: necessary to use a 'meat axe' to buldose through the city and make way for car lanes
- Opposed by Jacobs, who organised demonstrations against Moses

**Situationists**
- A movement where the city was seen not as one totality, not one machine, but a *patchwork* of different situations, where the *mind* is more important than the *material world* 
- Introduced the idea of psycho-geography, with improvised tours in the city that do not follow a straight line but follows desires


#### trends in the history of urban planning

- Modernisation and planning: Ildefonso Cerda
- Conservatism: Camillo Sitte (fond of 'crooked lines' as a break from monotonous areas of the modern city)
- Utopianism: Ebenezer Howard (garden city)
- Futurism: Sant Elia
- Modernism: Otto Wagner, Le Corbusier
- From universalism to individualism: Jane Jacobs, Kevin Lynch (using mental maps to understand how people read the city), George Cullen, Jan Gehl (life *between* buildings is more important than what is *in* the buildings)
- New urbanism: need to emphasise squares, streets, houses (the [[human scale]]), as the center of planning, using classic elements of city building
- Postmodernism
- Generic city: Koolhaas
- Cultural planning: Richard Florida, the Bilbao effect (using culture as a catalyst for urban development)

## CITY SQUARES

*Place de la concorde*
- "spirit of france, it is an x-ray of the french people" -Malaparte
- it follows the principles of Descartes: cold, logical, rationalistic, mathematical, meticulous

Perspectives on the city square
- 'plaza' is always something characteristic of the city, and of *life* in the city
- *analytical* perspectives: its history, sociology (social composition), anthropolgy (patterns on life), geography (location, topography), architecture, art (sculptures, screens), representations (in literature, paintings, movies), political functions (Ukrain, arab spring)
- *aesthetical and cultural* perspectives: location (in the centre or periphery), scale (big (may represent agrophobio, or fear of open spaces), small, pocket square), stability/mobility, closed/open, homogeneous/heterogeneous, colour and light, name of the square (history puts its mark on names and reflects political objectives, eg. place Royale -> place de la Revolution -> place de la Concorde)

*[[agora]]*, ancient greece
- ways of articulating, or celebrating the square: 
	- a procession
	- a competition
	- a dance

*forum and imperial fora*, ancient rome
- a new emphasis on the urban totality: an ensemble of squares
- first treatise on urban architecture by Vitruvius

*medieval market*, middle ages
- fall of rome and into walled medieval cities
- urban culture of antiquity disappeared, the forum (rome) is turned into a goat market
- medieval market serves primarily useful functions, they are complex and intimate
- there is an oral culture (when market starts and stops, what you are or aren't allowed to sell, there is a town crier)
- increasing homogeneity, with an integration of the market square with surroundings through *arcades* for example

17th century squares
- Covent garden, London; Plaza Mayor, Spain; Place des Vosges, Paris
- Emergence of 'royal' squares, for upper and royal classes who can enjoy the arcades around the square

*residential* square, 18th century england
- Soho Square; what is characteristic of residential squares is the private garden in the middle that is available for the residents of the square who have a key
- it has no representative function

*panorama* in the square
- gives a 360 view of the cityscape ('I live there!') or landscapes (Alps), warns of danger (wars, fires)

*[[postmodernism|postmodern]] square*
- eg. Piazza d'Italia, New Orleans
- eg. Las Vegas, a city of signs; the piazza is 'unamerican', americans feel awkward sitting in a square, and should instead be at home in front of the tv; public squares are meant for public and communal use, empty piazzas are eery
- double coated square, *almost humoristic interplay between past and present models

*city of the captive globe* Koolhas:
- " a square is the opposite of a monument, it has no solidity, no volume. A kind of pure space with no event, almost nothing to name about it" - SMLXL

## DOMESTICITY

The home is the "most important place in the world"
- Change from *public*, to the *private* sphere
- Is home the way to understand and analyse the modern city?

**Urbanity and domesticity**
- *The Poetics of Space*, Gaston Bachelard
- The idea of [[home]]
	- A place, even a  '[[utopia]]' of peace in which you are the master of the space; shelter from outside evils; 
	- Ideal roles of genders: women as the goddess of homes, and men as bread winners outside the home (John Ruskin)

**Home as the foundation of society**
- Kant: house, the home, is where society has its main source. "The residence is the onlly rampart against the dread of nothingness, darkness, and the obscurity of the past... to be at home is to recognize life's slow pace and the pleasures of sedentary meditation... *the man wihtout a home is a potential criminal*"

**Risk of anachronism and ethnocentrism**
- Risks when dealing with cultures
- Anachronisms: past generations may have completely different ways of conceiving the world (historians)
- Ethnocentrism: when you come from a culture, and project it onto your object of analysis (eg. englishmen interpreting colonies on the basis of Victorian culture)

**Domus and Familia**
- Domus
	- Domesticity and domination are derived from the same word but point to complete opposite ways of understanding home. The modern interpretation of **domesticity** does not refer to domination, or to slaves - but this may not always have been the case
	- 1. a household and hierarchy, to dominate (case in Ancient Rome, the man was the master of the home over the women, children, slaves)
	- 2. a community of love, a space without power
- Familia
	- In [[Ancient Rome]]: familia encompassed women, children and slaves

**Modern enchantment with miniatures**
- Humans have become happy amongst 'small things' in their homes (ref. Hannah Arendt)
- Victorian homes are filled with knick knacks. There is an increasing interest in the private sphere, the home. The most intense values of life, in this age of industrialisation, is found in the home
	- E.A Poe, *The Philosophy of Furniture* - furniture is so full of meaning, it has its own philosophie
	- Xavier de Maistre, *Voyage Autour de ma Chambre* - the room itself is interesting as a space you can explore, to the extent of Jules Vernes *Voyage Autour du Monde*

**The bourgeois home as a compensation for the lack of privacy in urban life**
- Walter Benjamin (on Victorian homes). By having soft upholstered chairs, curtains, etc., the bourgeois tries to escape the street and the outise
- "The traces of its inhabitant are molded into the interior. Here is the origin of the detective story, which enquires into these traces and follows these tracks"

What is the contrast to this type of (Victorian) home? **Glass architecture**
- Transparency, by living in a glass house, you prove that "we have nothing to hide", are a moral person and could never be a *criminal*
- Modern man shouldn't live in dusty interiors of Victorian homes, with tassels, blankets and pillows. A glass home is like a privaty *crystal palace* and one should enjoy the intimate relationship between the sun outside, and one's interior

**Bourgeois home**
- Dutch bourgeoisie (ref. readings)
	- Servants discouraged by taxation law
- Gendered roles and gendered spaces, with women in the home and men working outside
- Diminishing roles of servants, they are made invisible
- Private sleeping rooms are a symptom of the romantic marriages, based on love
- A loss of domain for women (ref. *A room of one's own*, Virginia Woolf)
	- before the bourgeois home, work and family life took place in the same house (eg. workshop, atelier would be in the family home). There was more equality between genders
	- 19th century: separation of work and home, with spaces reserved for factories, workshops, shopping, markets... -> a growing separation of the sexes

**Cult of domesticity**
- Women were the masters of the home, concentrated on the care of the home and the children

20th century
- A period where planners had great visions for a new private life, which matches the new machine world
- Le Corbusier: "the house is a *machine* for living in", "the armchair is a machine for sitting in". No longer is the armchair an upholstered chair, but a machine
- The Victorian home vs. the modern functionalist home

**Contemporary domesticity**
- Globalisation: "flying SAS feels like home"
- New family dynamics: new families, broken families, collage families, single living
	- Children are indoors, and not told to play outside; [[children]] cannot create their own private worlds because parents have their eyes on them all the time
	- New family types in Denmark:
		- 1960: 60% of families consist of father, mother and 1+ child
		- Today: this type of family is only 20%; number of seniors are rising
- Mixed use houses:
	- Combination of institutions, shops, private homes
	- Combination of privately owned and rented apartments


## MOBILITY

Railway **euphoria**: the railway as the main metaphore for understanding and interpreting our time
- Dali painting of the railway station in Perpignan, as a cosmo(?) vision

Where to put a railway?
- There was tension around where to place railways and where they should go
- "Next to the sexual drives, the railway "drives" are the strongest and most passionate" - JK Lauridsen, followed by Freud who saw trains and railways as a key symbol in the subconscious

Railway stations and [[nationalism]]
- Railways are what tied the nation together and opened it up outside its border
- Comes at the time when nationalism (and borders) is on the rise, a symbol of **pride** for citizens
- A symbol of political drive: where is this **instrument of progress** positioned?

The railway station
- A new building genre, invented after the arrival of trains in the city
- A train station competes with national monuments (eg. theatres), again creating a symbol of **pride** -> eg. Gare du Nord, St. Pancras, Gare Centrale (Antwerp)

**Scale**
- A very big scale
- Crowd as a challenge
- Division into social classes, eg. with waiting rooms 
- The station as an urban landscape (doves, smoke, no clear distinction between day and night)

A symbol of the 19th century
- Railway station delimits the old and new city
- Arriving in the city is done almost exclusively through the railway station

**Spatial structures**
- Stations are **absolute spaces**, independent of the surrounding landscape, with regular planes and lines that are not crooked - a geometric method, they cut through

**Temporal structures**
- Being on time, and agreeing on time, is primordial for the functioning of the railway
- Main driver for the synchronisation of time and creation of Greenwhich meantime

**Industrialism**
- The station as a machine and as a container for machines; the machine handles passengers and receives money
- Extreme rationality governs the plans: how to make the most effective organisation of this space?

**History and style**
- Divided between the past and present
- A confused building, combining ornamentation on the outside and its complete absence inside, making room for pure efficiency and calculated movements
- Stations can be a space of **luxury**, eg. Gare du Lyon et Le Train Bleu

The station meets reaction


## MUSEUMS

In Copenhagen:
- Museums started in the city center (To...), and moved to the suburbs (Louisiana)
- National Gallery: a building with architecture that displays "the best" that has been created; built in a period of "style confusing" (stilvervierung?)
- Louisiana: suburban, almost anti-urban, between water, trees and green lawns; the structure of the museum is built according to where the outside (trees) are oriented
- Arken: 1996, south Copenhagen, post-modernism, deconstructionism, a playful use of the vocabulary of architecture, name refers to the bible (irony on amassing the world's curiosities while the rest of the world is falling apart?)

What type of collection is in the museum?
- Collections of... a king/prince, a state, a nation, a society, an enterprise
- An important tool of nationalism (eg. nazis)
- A place where you learn to be a member of society, learn about values
- A private collection

17th century **baroque**:
	- Cabinet of Curiosities, Museum of Wormianum, 1621-1654
	- There is no rationality in this representation, but a juxtaposition of objects of extremely different kinds. Almost surrealist. Has elements from natural and cultural history

18th century **englightenment**:
- A new genre, **humanism, enlightenment and democracy**
- The museum is open for everyone, access is not only for the king/royals/upper class
- As a result, museums become specialised
- There are new relations between space and vision: use of glass to separate seeing and touching, clear passageways for transit, elevated vantage points from the gallery...

19th century:
- **Classicism**: monumentalism, permanence, universalism
	- eg. Glyptothek in Munich, 1816-39: combining old and new pinakotheks to create new image of the city
	- The idea of the museum as an instrument of **national** education
	- Using ancient Greek style because Greece was the cradle of democray
	- Message of the facade: however complez the range of exhibits inside
	- Museum Island, Berlin: Altes Museum
- **Historicism**: monumentalism, progression, universalism
	- Everything is arranged according to historical principles
	- The nation as the frame of evolution
	- The people and the imperial gaze: similar to world expositions, nations rob others of art, objects, to display in their museums

20th century
- **Modernism**: instrumentalism (over momunemtalism, the museum is an **instrument** in city building, the formation of the mind, the spiritual structure), change, individualism (your personal encounter with the art object is the most important)
	- Low key, neutral facades; the "abolishment" of any sense of public facade
	- Preference for glass, blurring lines between what is inside and what is outside
	- The "private experience" becomes much more important
	- "the works of art themselves create the architecture, dictating the spaces and prescribing the dimensions of the walls": a museum is not created by starting with a building and then putting art inside, but rather, it starts with the art and the building is moulded around it
	- A complete turn around from classicism
	- Eg. Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin

Late 20th **post-modernism**
- **Post-modernism**: instrumentalism, playfulness, individualism
- James Stirling's Neue Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart
- A period after modernism is marked by **cultural planning**, over **social planning**.
	- "There is no such thing as society" - Thatcher
	- Instead of/more than society, culture became the instrument of urban development
- Arken 1996, a new stimulus compared to the usual museum buildings; a museum as a house designed to house the culture of society
- Guggenheim Museum Bilbao 1997 by Frank Gehry
- Military Museum, Dresden
- Paul Klee Museum, 1998, Bern
- Centre Pompidou, the stairs outside the building show the museum as a cultural machine

Today:
- Museum visitors are better educated, through higher education; they are better equipped to relate (and critique) what is exhibited and narrated
- Visitors are customers: consumerist market world
- Return and repatriation of stolen museum objects: British Museum


## HOTELS

Linked to
- **Mobility**: linked to the history of transportation and rail roads
- **Domesticity**: hotels offer a home away from home

Etymology
- Hotel related to hospitality, stranger, guest; but also a host can be hostile
- **Hospitality + hostility**: an ambivalence in the origin of the word 'hotel'


### history

Universal hospitality
- Immanuel Kant on universal hospitality: "*hospitality is the right of a stranger not to be treated as an enemy when he arrives in the land of another. one may refuce to receive him when this can be done without causing his destruction; but so long as he peacefully occupies his place, one may not treat him with hostility... by virtue of their common possession of the surface of the eart, where, as a globe, they canot infinitely disperse and hence must finally tolerate the presence of each other. Originally, no one had more right than another to inhabit any corner of the eart*"
- 18th century: the word hotel in the modern meaning becomes part of cultural history; places where people can rent a room for a day, week, longer

Hotel related to markets and **capitalism**
- Guest, or customer?
- Hotels are fully capitalised spaces that do not openly acknowledge or reveal their capitalist foundation - if you don't have your credit card or money, get out of the hotel; but if you are able to pay, the interior is a paradise of comfort and glamour
	- "*There is an obvious attempt in capitalist societies to mask money's omnipresence to buffer its possibly unsettling effects and to lull the human being into believing in the possiblity of a life or at least moments beyond the reach of capital: this is especially the case in hotels*" - Bettina Mattthias, Hotel as Setting(2006)

Origins of the hotel industry
- First hotel building: 'City Hotel', New York, 1794
- First 'railway hotel': London and Birmingham, 1839
- A hotel offers the class of a nobleman, to a bourgeois for a week, or a month. You can pretend you are a nobleman, entering your own palace (personal, or impersonal?) which you have paid for, and you have the feeling of being on the highest step of the social ladder
- **Grand hotels**: Hotel du Louvre, Grand Hotel (Wien), Hotel d'Angleterre (Copenhagen)
	- Hotels as the quintessence of urban life, of urbanity and anonymity that you wish to experience in the city
- **Railway hotels**: St. Pancras (London) part of the St. Pancras station

Historical and cultural background
- Money economy
- Mobility, railways
- Tourism
- Rise of the middle classes - who long for this feeling of being noblemen
- Entertainment - fun, hotels offered music, balls and ballrooms

### structure

- Inspiration from apartment buildings, 'the most comfortable way of living today'
- Interwar period: hotels became a 'universal fascination', with two opposite social ideas; on one hand side the hotel which is an international, cosmopolitan place, and on the other hand, 'heimat', feelings of a home, a cosy feeling related to the area around home; cosmopolitans vs. traditionalists

Hotel as a machine
- A machine to take money from customers
- A machine when looking at what happens in the foreground (guests, lobby, lounge) and behind the scenes (housemaids, chefs, porters, lift boys) which make the hotel *function*
- "A gigantic system of press-buttons", transforming a room into automaton

The hotel and the city
- What is the relationship?
	- The hotel is a concentration of all the power in the city: hotel as a microcosm, a place where you have a privileged access to the city, where you can stand in your window and have a grand view over the city
	- A place to get away from the city... how? Using the railway, which takes you to the hotels; the town square, where you will find the grand, finest hotels

### architecture

- **Revolving door** invented at a time that Grand Hotels flourished all over Europe and America; revolving doors used as a symbol of 'destinies'; "*a hotel must have a revolving door... if there is no revolving door, there is no speed, and that is something wrong*", almost a required element!
- **Lobby**: Edward Hopper (interwar painter on loneliness in the big city)
- **Lounge**
- **Grand staircase**
- **Lift and lift boy**
- **Ball rooms**: the hotel splendour; Scott Fiztgerald in The Great Gatsby
- **Corridors**: the opposite of the hotel splendour
- **Rooms**: intimacy, 'intimacy's shrine' filled with objects and furniture that an indiscriminate number of people will use, placed in a room that says nothing about us

Recent reflections on society:
- Frederic Jameson on postmodernism and the Bonaventura Hotel (LA): a postmodernist way of treating space, characterised by features of postmodernism (which is what????)
	- Three atypical entrances
	- Doesn't relate to its context and is set apart from the buildings around from its distinct skin
	- The elevators convey a sense of 'spectacle and excitement', a society in which everything, including commercial transactions are dressed up

### sociology

Simmel, Veblen

Chicago school of sociology (circa 1915)
- People live in apartment and tenement housing, as one lives in a hotel: in proximity but without knowing one another <- one effect of urban life

### literature



#### VinziRast

What is the same
- Services: food, bed + sheets, various amenities (toothbrush, toothpaste, soap...), information on services and areas of interest (not for touristic purposes, but for essentials like job hunting, doctors (covid vaccinations), recommendations for other shelters...)
- The building and facilities: has a restaurant, a common recreational room, an inner courtyard
- The sleeping quarters: like a hostel, with bunk beds
- Wake up service ;) 

What is not the same:
- Forced hours of lights on and off
- Sleeping quarters: very little privacy
- Surveillance and strict hours: lights on and off at 7am/10pm, 

Is it a hotel?
Yes, people stay here temporarily. You cannot stay longer than 100 days a year, there is a cleaning team who cleans the sheets, towels, bathrooms.
A bed is exclusively yours for the night being but is not owned by you


But no. Most people have no where else to go, because they don't fit in to society or cannot afford anything else. They don't fit into any of the primary reasons for using hotels: tourism, business, visiting friends or family, 
You don't have the freedom or anonymity as you do in a hotel, you don't have a key and cannot come and go as you please after hours 

Is it a home? 
Yes, some people are living here indefinitely and paying the rent of 60 euros a month (incl. breakfast and dinner)
The bed is not exclusively yours, another may sleep in it the morrow

But no. You pay per night, have no rental contract, have no keys, have to abide by strict rules and opening hours. You cannot leave anything during the day, you cannot put anything on the walls, you don't have a shelf

## FUN CITY

**The meaning of entertainment**
- Unter-halten, entre-tenir: to hold something mutually, to support, reciprocity
- A dichotomy: boredom and entertainment

Play and entermtainment
- "only when playing is man fully man"
- From play to entertainment... entertainment supposes a mental support, a division between mind and the material world

**19th century mass entertainment business**
- 1. requires a large and concentrated urban population - urban life and happiness are intricably linked
- 2. there needs to be sufficient money for people to buy cheap and regular entertainment - entertainment is something **you can buy and is preferably cheap**
- 3. sufficient leisure time (free time, freizeit) to make commercial exploitation possible
- 4. an urban transport system to take people to the entertainment places and 'palaces'
- 5. application of technology to entertainment - needs a crowd, and a new industry 
	- [[amusement parks]]: a place to practice what it means to be living in a metropolis, and with new industries (eg. with music, with steam engines...); this type of place needs a crowd to be enteraining, an empty amusement park is a boring place
- [[railways]] as an illustration of these 5 preconditions for entertainment through Jaques Offenbach's *La vie Parisienne*
	- 1 .the setting is in Paris, a large and dense metropolis
	- 2. the cast have money, or know how to get money
	- 3. the story revolves around a new social group, the tourists, who have sufficient leisure time
	- 4. the action starts at a railroad in Paris
	- 5. technology is used to recreate the spectacular glitter of modern Paris

[[Funscapes]]
- Arabesque forms: *"the suppleness of its line and its caprice are able to embrace the twists an d turns, the spontaneity and chance encouters, of life itself"* the arabesque as a way to signal that something fun is taking place, ie. the opposite of rigid rectangles and straight lines
- Spherical forms: "roundness is the suitable shape for objects that belong nowhere and everywhere"; round forms have a danger of upsetting a world of well-defined shapes (and uses?)

Examples
- The circus and **thrills**: acrophilia and acnophilia
	- Trapezists are defying gravity, vs. the clown with large and clunky shoes is demonstratively tied to the earth and tied down by gravity
- Entertainment cities: Tivoli, Disneyland, Park Asterix
- Post-industrialism and neoliberalism: 
	- Las Vegas: a place where the architect concentrates the urban and entertainment experience, a place that combines crime and entertainment (defining of Las Vegas)
	- Dubai: places that are demonstrations of how far money can go,and how the world can be recreated (a city in a desert)


.... it could go on and on and on. as is characteristic of entertainment - it goes on and on and on.m


## SCHOOLS

**Etymology**: leisure, idleness; school is institutionalised idleness

**Bells and Cells**
- Pink Floy The Wall
- Purpose: to prepare people for the working life of the industrial society. Emphasis on uniformity, conformity and mass production
- Schools defined by strict structures, walls, an architecture designed to make people **behave** and to create **discipline**

Space of the school
- Monumentality, power and surveillance through symmetry
- Entering a school is like entering a new **life world**

**Discipline**
- In large rooms, many can be taught at once and opportunities for crime and disorder are limited
- Dark sides of Enlightenment: at the same time that liberties were discovered, it also discovered disciplines
- Discipline and distribution of individual space: enclosed, heterogeneous space that is limited to the teacher and pupils (another teach or foreign pupil is intrusive)

19th century schools
- Schools becoming monumental, more than other buildings in the city. 
- 19th century nationalism: **nation-building project** with schools as the foremost instrument because that is where pupils learned the national language, history, literature, art, patriotic songs.

Rivalry between church and school
- period of secularisation where the church becomes less important

20th century: Copernican revolution
- John Dewey metaphorically expressed vision based on Copernicus: child becomes the sun around which the 'appliances of education' revolves - pupil at the center of teaching, similar to Freud's expression of 'his majesty the baby'
- "we never educate directly but indirectly - by means of the nevironment"; children should interact with the environment and the context of the world

Changing historical ideals
- Values of **disciplinary school**
	- Disciplilne, purity, punctuality, obedience, dutifulness
- School of the **welfare society** (post-WWII)
	- Functionalism
	- Horizontality: groundscrapers (and not skyscrapers); a social horizontality, closer relationship between teachers and pupils (teacher is no longer a god above the pupils but on the same scales)
	- Nature (sun): important element, sun is a key value of functionalism
	- Open plan: walls between disciplines are opened which should create more modern, flexible pupils able to react positively on impulses; open plan school (1970s) as the extreme example of this (creates a lot of noise)
- The school of the **experience society**
	- Individualisation
	- Privatisation
	- Cross-disciplinary

**Functionalism**
- Skolen ved sundhet: lots of glass, large windows to let in *sun* (functional element), limited ornaments (unlike classical schools)

**Open plan schools**
- 1970s; creating an institutional frame to match the idea of the open society
- A way of using space that is full of surprises; open, modular, **elastic**, multi-purpose spaces (Orestad Gymnasium)
- An elastic space to create an elastic mindset
- School buildings traditionally give an impressive feeling of monumentality, a building which is ground and cannot be moved; open schools give a lighter impression #presentation


# seminars

### seminar 1

#### Nationalmuseets Klunkelejlighed

Analysing a plan of the Christiansen house 
- An L shaped building, with a dining room as a circular room being the central element connecting the two sides of the home
- One side has the entertainment spaces, with living rooms, dining rooms, drawing, salon and study rooms, where guests would be entertained and 'impressed'
- The other side has the bedrooms (of the daughters and couple), and the maids' bedrooms
- The kitchen is pushed into the house, away from the entertainment spaces and closer to the maids; the bathroom and toilet are also pushed away
- Two staircases of different sizes and location, a smaller one in the back for the maids and a larger one in the front for the owners and guests
- **SIZE**
	- Different sizes of staircases, show the importance of who uses them
- **LOCATION**
	- Entertainment rooms are facing the front of the building, with a view on the canal
	- Bathroom and toilet located in the end of the house, near the maids
	- Kitchen is away from entertainment rooms, to keep smells away, near the maids
- Children: in the 1930s (??), children are recognised as having their own phase of life and are not just "small adults"; 
- The **bicycle** gave women a reason to dress in a way that allowed them to move (lol); so there is a relationship between the invention of the bicycle, and the women's liberation movement


# readings

#### elizabeth wilson, *The Rhetoric of Urban Space*, 1995
- Talks about Jameson's postmodernism, "Postmodernism and The Cutlural Logic of Late Capitalism", where in [[postmodernism]] you are lost in a sense-less urban space with no center, the suburbs blend into endless same-ness, where places like Silicon Valley are ugly places empty of any soul
- **Private spaces**
	- The 'new indurstrial city' of the 21st century has created private spaces "as a refuge from public dirt and squalor" (p. 149). Instead of upgrading public space to be desirable, we privatise what is nice to keep away from others who might degrade our experience
	- Talks about embellishing the private sphere for *women*, how [[garden cities]] were made to "improve the domestic environment, and did assume that women's primary role would be domestic" (p. 149)
- **Women in public spaces**
	- Women were always guarded, esp. young and unmarried middle-class women who didn't work; in the 19th century, when "patriarchal control" loosened, planners desired consumerist ways to entertain women and "provide more and more seductions" in the shape of exhibitions, department stores, refreshment rooms
	- Interestingly, these consumerist places with dedicated spots for women to interact and spend time *liberated* middle-class women and gave them a space to go, unaccompanied by male figures
	- Still, women (working class and other) could not enter the job market on the same terms as men
	- "Unnerved at the sight of a new, rough, rban female proletariat throughing the streets..." (p. 150)
- **Anti-urban ideology** int he 19th century was centered around the fear of losing patriarchal control over women, and there was a desire to return the control of the household to the man; this did not work (women's emancipation continued, even if it is still not fulfilled); women were seen as a central *problem*
- Women experience urban space differently from men - they do not feel as safe, and thus look out for themselves and each other. This has the effect that men are more like to be *assaulted* in the streets, and women abused in the privacy of the domestic sphere
- **Richard Sennett**
- ==**Dystopian rhetoric** of Jameson, re-postmodernism==, people are living in an inner city "fraught with danger and horror", amongst prostitutes and drunks, making the city dangerous (but tentalising and intriguing?); in movies, the hero is the suburban male who rescues the young woman from the debaucherie of the city
- Florence was planned to be turned into a complete museum (?!! dystopian postmodernism!!) and residents moved to a nearby town for the closign off and reconstruction of Florence; fortunately this never happened
- **Post urban spaces**: talks about museums being the same as consumerist spaces/malls, where the final stop is the shop or cafe attached. The V&A's 1980s ad read "*an ace caff with a rather good museum attached*"
- **Consumerisation of space**: similarly to museums, Wilson says that airports are increasingly indistinguishable from malls; massively *consumerised* urban spaces are stripping cities of [[diversity]] and breeding [[uniformity]]
	- If you do not have "the passport of money" you are increasingly excluded from urban life, you are an "underclass" or even an "unclass"; malls exclude beggars and the homeless, so the middle upper classes can have a 'pleasant' experience undisturbed by these other people --> **invisibility** of the social ills of the city, deresponsibilises people, creates distance between classes, raises inequality. Think about the homeless and drug problem in SF, and the wealthy residents, engineers and googlers turning a blind eye and just 'ignoring' the problematic spaces
- **Invisibility** is a "crucial feature of modern inequality" (p. 158), where those in the suburbs/banlieues and out of sight of the wealthy inner-city residents, they are looking in 
	- Characterising people are visible/invisible, goes back to the divide of the **public and private**, which is eroded by technology entering the home and advertising the rest of the world that is up for consumption
	- And interesting that "public life" takes places in privately owned property and buildings (eg. malls), and publicly-owned does not mean there is public access (eg. municipal housing)

#### møller, *the parks of copenhagen 1850-1900*, 2010
- Because parks do not generate any income, in cities where land prices are so high, why did city planners build parks at all?
- The parks were built in the 1800s, after fires and wars destroyed the city and the medieval walls were no longer relevant. A movement considered dirty air as transmitting diseases (the theory of *miasma*) and thus clean-smelling, fresh air was regarded as healthy. Plus, cholera epidemics and the Public Health Act (1848) encouraged clean, open air spaces for recreation and exercise; plus, overcrowding was starting to become a problem - the population grew fast between 1850-1880, from 150k to 235k
- Research into air quality revealed that decomposing organic matter, high levels of CO2, methane, nitrogen, were high in neighbourhoods with high mortality rates
- To remedy the density and deaths from poor hygiene and air conditions, multiple ideas were brought forward by politicians, planners, thinkers:
	- gardens as wide open spaces
	- boulevards as large corridors for ventilation, with seaside parks
	- a combination of squares, parks, streets, to resemble a "full pulmonary organs of a living creature" (p. 115)
- *Demarcation line* --> where is this?? they mention it as like a line where the city... starts? stops? where the city walls were? the old defense wall? 
- Ferdinand Meldahl proposed the plan to transform the old defence walls into a park
- The Sanitary Movement lasted until 1870s; when bacteriology was becoming more accepted, the argument that parks were necessary for public health didn't stand, moreover cholera was shown to spread through contaminated sewers (water) and not through bad ventilation (air) (although this doesn't mean that bad ventilation is not harmful). Miamism was eventually ruled out after the end of the last cholera epidemic in the 1880s
- in the 1900s, public parks were still perceived as essential to public health but for other reasons than clean air - for physical exercise and sports


- Regimes
	- Until 1848: absolutist regime
	- 1848: constitutional monarchy

#### larsson and thomassen, *urban planning in denmark*
- 

#### kvorning, *copenhagen, formation, change and urban life*
- Recap of Copenhagen's urban planning and development, including urban structural typologies and building typologies. Reminiscent of the planning stages in [[principles of planning and urbanism]]!
- **Formation**
	- City and landscape (rural?) are in a [[dialectic]] relationship, push and pull; the city 'eradicates' the landscape, and 'absorbs' it in built-up form
	- Copenhagen was a [[fortified city]], with a strong military presence. Its medieval walls were doubly protected by Christianshavn, reclaimed land serving as a military base for protection (circa 1500?)
	- Water was a key feature of the city, encircling it, and determining the logic of the city's growth
	- Growth was *slow*: there was a lot of reclaimed, empty land for development but these areas were sparsely developed; "slowness became a characteristic feature in the process of Copenhagen's growth"
	- A Renaissance to Baroque to Industrial phase (p. 117)
		- Renaissance: "an abstract, preconceived ideal based on straight streets and a simple geometrical order"
		- Baroque: "a highly developed hierarchisation, ordered systems based on great organising axes culminating at their point of intersection"
	- 19th century
		- Development of suburbs, of "summer residences mainly for the wealthy (in the north of Cph)... the king's summer palace"  (p. 119)
		- Development similar to the [[Ringstrasse]], with monumental developments, catering to the social and cultural aspirations and trends of the (new) middle class: eg. Botanical Gardens "a combination of promenade and education"
	- Early 20th century
		- Increasing involvement of the state in urban planning
		- [[Social Democratic]] influences and the welfare state
			- Post-1930s housing crisis: emphasis on building social housing (with courtyards), gardens, kindergardens and child care...
			- "Danish brick"
			- "The good home with easy access to green spaces, with good new schools for the children, with the first creches, kindergartens and after-school insitutions, with common facilities for residents and with small local shops placed in various apartment buildings or in small local shopping centers formulated what is still today *the immediately appealing Social Democratic vision of a new future for the Danish worker - on the way to the [[welfare state]]*" (p. 122)
			- Increasing prosperity and industrialisation, as well as standardisation, make it possible for the [[working class]] to purchase homes
		- Mid-20th century
			- Regional planning and the [[fingerplan]] arrive
			- The car shapes regional planning, residentials areas do not have to be situated near a train station. New planning regulations are put in place to control development
		- 1980s
			- Focus goes away from the suburbs and returns to the city center, "to the classical city and classical urban life"
- **Change**
	- Change is about the *additions* that are made to the city in a new context, and the *departures* from existing forms --> dialectic relationship between the past and future
	- "*For a period after its formation a district functions and develops in accordance with the ideas and needs on which it was based - it is inhabited by people who have the same ideas as those inscribed in the structure and expression of the district. But at some point the tension between the original needs and new needs becomes so great that the district breaks up*" (p. 125)

#### bloom, *superkilen: participatory park extreme!*
- tlrd; Superkilen is supposed to represent the 'super'-diversity of the neighbourhood it is embedded in, Nørrebro. In a playful colour palette, with curiosities from around the world (from a trash can to a playground or bike parking), the park's narrative at home and internationally is about diversity and integration. 
	- *'A big part of understanding Superkilen comes from online narratives or by using a smart phoen to decipher hidden park narratives'*
	- However, its design from the start goes against the very principles it claims to uphold.
	- No resident was consulted during the design of the park (no participation, no democracy), although *"Copenhagen wants to brand itself as a palce where the government and its people go hand in hand in making the city"*
	- It is of poor quality, with plaques going missing and not being replaced, or the indoor flooring not being suitable for outdoors and being actually dangerous
	- it is awkward, with many things that "do not sit comfortably together", with bike racks in places people would not park bikes, with benches facing a way people do not want to face
	- It isn't suited to Denmark's climate and is an insult to enviromentalism and ecological concerns, eg. the red maples from China are not thriving and are growing fungus
	- The soil uprooted from from the Ghaza strip and placed in Copenhagen is a violent theft from Palestine
	- "*I am curious to know how diversity and integration are achieved with this park. What does it mean that a bunch of white people are making representations of diversity without really including the people they  are making them about except in perfunctory roles? Does it work by getting "the diverse people" to identify with inanimate objects from around the world, many of whicch were broken shortly after being put out?*" (p. 8) **diversity washing!**
- **Public space** and life being increasingly controlled by **private enterprise** as public spending is reduced
	- Realdania is the 'democratically run', 'philanthropic' business funding the park
	- Branding the project with "[[public participation]] as the driving force of the design leading towards the maximum freedom of expression" but in reality no one was consulted, or only a select few individuals
	- *"one way we can recognise that we are living in a neoliberal society is when corporations, high finance, and non-elected organisations and individuals start having an outsized role in shaping public life"* (p. 13)
- Space dictates how one ought to behave, *"spacial configurations naturalize social relations by transforming contingent forms into a permanent landscape that appears as immutable rather than open to contestation. By providing a shared background, spatial forms serve the function of integrating individuals into a shared conception of reality"* (p. 4)
	- when you enter a space, you recognise, or feel, how you are supposed to behave (eg. school vs. train ticket office), and not behaving as expected or desired by othes will engender consequences
- Theory of [[governmentality]] , or the art of governing, is the power that an authority uses to exert control over its population, on all scales
	- The park is heavily controlled, with graffiti being removed within 24h. This is a strong contrast to the reality in the nearby streets, where "*the city seems to stop caring*"
- Norrebro as a particular neighbourhood, from gang violence to gentrification. Multiple stories of grassroots plans for parks, and push against cafes gentrifying the neighbourhood
- City signs always show a *"sterile space"*, where dirt, homelessness, elderly and disabled, trash and can collecters are out of view

#### daniela sandler, *incarnate politics: the rhetorics of german reunification in the architecture of berlin*


#### lane, *national romanticism: new capitals*,

- Need to create a national capital meant there as a need for a national architecture that was "modern, identified wiht history (but not with the history of the old nobility and old princedoms), and clearly sumbolic of a new unity in the modern era" 

#### dovey and fisher, *designing for adaptation: the school as sociological spatial assemblage*

#### schivelbusch, *Railroad Space and Railroad Time*

- Rail as a the "annihilation of space and time", where "distnaces practically diminish in the exact ratio of the speed of personal locomotion"; **a shrinking of space**, or the "temporal shrinking of transportation" because space is still the same but more accessible
	- Everything, towns/harbours/villages are drawn nearer to each other by a percentage (2/3s?) as the speed of rail increases
	- The "durée", or duration, of a journey is dependent on **transport technology**
- Transportation technology as participants in the development of tourism industry
	- Destruction of natural landscapes like the lake district
	- "*For the twentieth century tourism, the world has become one big department store of landscapes and cities*" (p. 40)
- 1884: international conference on time standards held in Washington DC divided the world into timezones; this was led and helped the train times


#### Knoch, *Creative Urban Milieus: Historical Perspectives on Culture, Economy and the City*

Grand Hotels
- As Urban "interzones", in the same movement as department stores and railway stations, "modern interzones of entertainment, social interaction and consumption... **between the conventional public sphere and private rooms, hotels in particular offered a transitory and transitional zone at central locations of the city's web**" -> shelters also as transitory and transitional zones
	- **Transitory**: many are migrant, documented or not, some stay for a short amount of time (a day, few days, a week) and/or disappear and come back a few weeks, months or years later
	- **Transitional**: a temporary space to sleep before you can be more 'settled', assuming the goal is to get out of homelessness
- "Spheres of **exclusiveness, elegance, and almost ceremonial rituals**, but also as sites of erotic temptation and moral disorder"
- "Urban hotels in particular, due to their close connection wiht industrial, commercial and entertainment developments were stages of modern life without the attribute of artificiality like in theatres and the fictionality of artistic representations"
- Grand hotels served a **social function**, supported by the interior architecture: there was "a main hall, a number of rooms nad spaces with different social functions, the distinction between front and back area, represntative staircases or seating arrangements...", "hotels became stages for urban social life" 
- How the hotel started: 
	- rail travel from middle and upper classes
	- business travel requesting more hotel accommodation
	- cities commercialising, modern developments as 'cultural shopping windows'
	- rise of town vacations (ie. city breaks)
	- hotels represent/are idealised as represetnations of the importance and economic strength of the city
	- demand for social space in distinct and luxurious environment
- Critique of the hotel as *too* impersonal and anonymous, too little homeliness
- **"Travelling modernity: luxury hotels and urban spaces"**
	- Feelings of cultural superiority in first class American hotels
- **"Living organisms: hotels as entrepreneurial city spaces"**
	- Age of conspicuous consumption
	- "A Grand hotel is really a government in itself" (p. 10 of pdf)
	- Hidden worlds of the hotel, in the kitchen, cellars, engine rooms, guaranteed a perfect service
	- Hotels presented as miniature cities
- **"Public Stages: Luxury Hotels and Urban Social Life"**
	- "luxury hotels offered transient spaces for informal intercourse which could be used for acts of emancipation, for the loosening of gender relations and moral codes, and as savety-valves for generational conflicts within families. Smoking women, dancing young women, and flirting couples made ample use of the surroundings in hotel spaces" (p. 10 pdf)
	- Social life of the elites in early 1900s: hotels trying to attract elites by offering dining spaces for "regular, public and informal gatherings"
