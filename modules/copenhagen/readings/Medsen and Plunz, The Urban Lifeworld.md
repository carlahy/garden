Over looking as multiple meanings
- 1. As looking over head from a high view point: regional and master planning

- 3. Going against power, in favour of a "strange reality"
- 4. Over-looking: more than visuals, using other senses (hearing, smelling, feeling)

Crystal Palace, NYC:
- In glass and steel, represents modernity
