## notes

The course establishes the basic principles of a humanistic ([[humanities]]) approach to the city, and uses [[cultural theory]] from the 1850s to today in order to understand the city as an **[[urbanity]]**

Setup of the lectures:

I. Topic
II. Urban culture
III. Cultural theory


### (intro) function and signification in modern urban culture

[[Urban culture]] - the object of analysis
[[Cultural theory]] - the approach, or tool

#### definitions and dimensions of the concept of culture

What is [[culture]]?
- Widespread word, also in urban planning: **cultural planning** organise their development around art museums, artists, experiences, in order to [[city branding|brand]] the city
- Culture is between art and the everyday (which are not complete opposites)

Aspects of culture: culture as **cultivation, as habit, and as reflexivity**. Culture is all of these concepts at the same time.

1.  **[[cultivation]]** of the soul; from 'soil' to 'soul'
2. **habits**: an important in the welfare state in Denmark, culture is defined by a social democratic politician as "*culture is habit taken in the most basic sense of the word*"; culture should be for **everybody**, not the few but the many; it isn't something that has nothing to do with the way people live, where you go to a specific place (eg. theatre) to find it; rather, culture is what happens in the mundane everyday life; an **inclusive** point of view
	1. **historical self reflection**: why are habits as they are? they are related to the way we think, socially determined patterns, that could be questioned (eg. why do we sit and the lecturer stands? why do we close the door? these are habits, that can change very easily when reflected upon; eg. during corona, no one was in classroom)
3. **reflexivity**: an artist represents reality with their own interpretations
	1. **Artists** painting in the street: eg. a woman painting in a public square, painting depicts child playing in street, with the Eiffel tower appearing in the back; public urban life is represented

#### roland barthes

*La Tour Eiffel, 1964* 
- The Tower is "a naturalised component in the Parisian cityscape". It has become a way for people to orient themselves.
- It is a particular kind of monumental architecture, an example of modern construction, "built with air", typical of modern times
- Illustrates that architecture serves both as **use and function** , and as **fantasy and imagination**. Eiffel had to defend the tower as 'useful', because modern times were useful, functional times. 
- The Tower is an **abstract form** with attracts a lot of **meaning**. Barthes analyses the Tower as a triangle: 
	- at a **glance**: 'regard', gaze; as if you were climbing the Tower
	- as an **object**: a major example of modern architecture; the function becomes a spectacle (eg. structure built by an engineer, the elevators operate on an oblique line and not directly vertical)
	- as a **symbol**
- This shows the potentials of *signification*
- Space is more than function, it serves as **signification** 

#### humanistic urban studies: the urban dimension

In cities, you live in the midst of what may become your object of study. You are not at a distance from what you are studying, rather, you are embedded in it inevitably (subjectivity?).
So how can you study something you are surrounded by? You cannot have a city as a totality in front of you, because you are inside, so you have to focus on a fragment of it.
There is always an element of interpretation.

Relevant strategies for delimiting an object of study: reconstruction of fragments

Interpretation: a critical strategy in urban culture and societies

### (part 1) perception and lifeworld in copenhagen

*Architectural Perception and Experience in Steen Eiler Rasmussen*

The argument: in order to understand, design, improve cities, you have to think about human factors. Things should *work* for people (function), but space must also have a signification (*meaning*). Roland Barthes = architecture is FUNCTION and FANTASY.

#### I. the copenhagen school

Culture is habits taken in the most simple sense of the word. It is not super defined things, nothing flashy. Architecture is an ingredient of our everyday life

[[Steen Eiler Rasmussen]]: the most representative and pedagological of Danish architects. 

Mobilising the amateurs of the lifeworld to the benefit of quality in architecture.
- Critique of modern homes, people being "doomed to live in and gaze upon (houses which) are on the whole without quality"
- Architects should not think of their own ambitions only, but think about the [[habits]] that are widespread amongst the general population

But how is reality? 2 poles:
- **Optical approach**: materialised in tourists constantly taking photos, of what is strange/new/different to you, in order to keep a trace. Consciously looking at built environmnet
- **Tactical approach**: not a focus on the monument itself, but of the everyday practices there, 'habits'; an observation of how people can take monumental architecture and use it in their everyday, and in exchange learn about urban space/built environment around them; *playing* and learning *unconsciously*, feeling the elements without realising
	- eg. observing children playing at the Santa Maria Maggiore church, the photo is of the kids, the steps on the back of the church, and how the space is used in everyday life; not a photo of the monument itself (Rasmussen, p. 16)
	- Experience of the architect/observer: the architect observing and writing an inaccessible experience. "As I sat in the shade watching them, I sensed the whole three-dimensional composition as never before" (p. 17)

Triangular composition: tourist / school children / observer-architect

**Mimetic learning** by repeating what you learn, you transform it and translate it into knowledge that pushes yourself (mind and body) to a new, elevated stage. 
Eg. children playing with a ball against a wall, understanding the composition of the wall through the ball which acts as an extension of your body.


#### II. rasmussen and theory: three spatial principles

Three spatial principles
- **Solids**: "legemer" (body)
- **Voids**: negative forms in the sense that it is empty, but also positive forms that reinforce the architecture. Give a kind of bodily feeling
	- vase or faces?
- **Colour planes**: a depth added to the perspectives of solids and voids; it came into consciousness during time of Rasmussen

eg. the ==Pantheon==, Rome:
- A solid from the outside, a cylindrical volume
- From the inside, the monument is a void "in the most liberal way" insofar as the roof has an opening where the sun and rain come down. A 'pantheist' monument in connection with nature
- Voids are actually present on the outside too - indents and niches in the walls 
- Floor is covered in coloured and patterned planes

eg. ==St. Marc's square== and Basilica, Venice:
- Array of coloured tiles and mosaics on the floors, and stones on the walls

eg. Le Corbusier villa in Paris:
- White and geometric from the outside, expects to be the same inside
- However, inside has an array of colours and rooms with no white (rose floors, light yellow walls, dark brown or blue accent wall...)
- Furniture rooted to the floor (immoveable?)
- Ramp replacing stair cases

From proportion via *scale* to *rhythms*
- Rhythm in space, in human movements

Architecture and human life:
- Architecture can only be understood through the experience of human life. Architecture needs to understand the life style of the people who will use the space (from university to homes), and be determined by who will use the space and how
- *Construction playgrounds*: playgrounds in Denmark with tools and materials for kids to explore with

Architecture as a framework around human living
- It isn't necessary to abandon rectangular forms, we need not get rid of them to support human life; it's easy to move through rectangular rooms and regular forms. 
- *Even if life is chaotic and unpredictable, space doesn't need to be*

## seminars

### intro seminar

SIGN = SIGNIFIANT / SIGNIFIÉ (signifier/signified)

**Signifier**: what designates the idea of something (eg. 'apple', 'Eiffel Tower', a 'Ford T')
**Signified**: that which the signifier signifies, a meaning, an idea; this can change overtime, metamophasises. It has a *historical* dimension (eg. what an apple means, what the Eiffel Tower represents, what a Ford T entails...)

eg. 'Ford T' designates a car, but used to have a different signification than it does today. It used to *mean* modernity, but now is old fashioned. The *signifier* stayed the same, but the *signified* changed.

A city is always moving, changing, evolving, even if it might look the same, because the built form does not change as fast as society may.

## readings

#### *Semiology of the Urban*, Roland Barthes
- [[Roland Barthes]] was a french philosopher, theorist, [[semiotics|semiotician]] 
- *Semiology and the Urban*
	- A text about the importance of semiology (the study of signs) in the city
	- Qs: Signified and signifiers; Does [[signification]] mean the same thing as meaning?; Signifying spaces
	- Introduces Kevin Lynch's way of interpreting a city, "in the same terms as the consciousness perceiving it" (p. 159). Lynch has semantic defintion of the urban based on discrete units (axes, nodes, edges, landmarks...)
	- There is a conflict between the **rational** (scientific and calculated planning, utilitarian purposes, functional necessity reason) and **signification** (meaning assigned, subjectivity, 'semantic charge'). A city cannot be built on reason alone, there is another force out of the control of science and reason which shapes it. "it is growing daily more evident that a city is a tissue formed not of equal elements whose functions we can enumerate, but of strong and neutral elements, or ... of marked and unmarked elements" (p. 160)
	- An example of the conflict between signification and reality: geographically, two neighbourhoods may be adjoining and share a physical border, thus be in proximity to one another; however in people's interpretations and imaginaries, these neighbourhoods are distinct and unrelated. 
	- Barthes says that the "language of the city" must move from the metophorical (eg. "language of flowers") to the real, for which we need the technique of **symbols**
	- **Symbolism, signified and signifiers**
	- The city center is an empty focal point
	- 
- *The Eiffel Tower*
	- Speaks about the omnipresence of the Tower, which is seen from every angle in Paris but also *sees* everything. Barthes gives human-like qualities and senses to the Tower, "touch", "sees", is seen. Later, he also gives super-human or god-like qualities to the Tower (p. 170), it is "neither brain nor organ... the Tower is merely the witness, the gaze which discreetly fixes, with its slender signal, the whole structure - geographical, historical, and social - of Paris space" (p. 170)
	- The Tower is also a *symbol*, "belongs to the universal language of travel". Everyone knows about the tower, it lives in our imaginations, its a "symbol of Paris, of modernity, of communication, of science or of the 19th century".
	- As a symbol, it is powerful. It is not purely **functional** (which was one of its critiques before/when/after it was built), and it does not have any material use. But, it has power through its symbolism. The meaning we (society) attaches to it changes, "who can say what the Tower will  be for humanity tomorrow?" (p. 166). The Tower then aquires a mythical quality ("the overwhelming muth of the Tower" (p. 166)). Having no use is rarely 'allowed', as all planned urban structures are meant to have a purpose
	- Talks about the concept of **panorama**, which is "an image we attempt to decipher, in which we try to recognise known sites, to identify landmarks". The Tower offers a panorama (with itself at the center). When looking at a panorama, you see what yourself know, and "decipher" what you are looking at such that you "find signs within it" (p. 168)
	- Gives distinct "functions of human life" starting from the level of the Eiffel tower, down to the ground level, functions ranging from "pleasure" of Montmartre to business at the center, and finally study, spreading into residential, green space, and blue-collar work (p. 170)
	- The way he speaks of the Tower as an omnipresent figure seeing all and being seen by all reminds me of a type of surveillance state mechanism, 1984, dystopian Brave New World. Is this what he hints at, when he says "*the Tower ultimately reunites with the essential function of all major human sites: [[autarchy]]*" (p. 172) ?
	
 #### *Experiencing architecture*, steen eiler rasmussen, 1962

**Scale and Proportion** (chap. V)
- Humans like things that are *harmonious*, but what is harmony? Harmony relates to **scale and proportion**mathematics, (correct) proportions; harmony can be produced by following mathematical ratios, there is a rationale/explication behind harmony. People *want and love* harmony
- Comparison of architecture to music: they both have simple dimensions (ie. the basics of what is harmonious). Archi is "frozen music"
	- Two forces need to cooperate in order to be harmonious: in music, two waves with a frequency ratio of 15:16 will produce "weird, quavering, uneven sequence"; There are no wavelenghts in archi, so irregularities and unharmonious things must be discovered by careful **measuring**
- [[golden ratio]] mathematical describes what is harmonious or beautiful, even "holy". eg. the pentagram
- 1920s Scandanavia: move from "romantic tendencies in architecture of the previous generation and to **formulate clear aesthetic principles**"
	- Formualte -> formula -> mathematics
	- BUT, when a building is planned in perfect proportions (eg. Copenhagen philharmonic building), you can't experience the golden ratio and the "interrelationship in the proportions" like you can in progressive, **natural** phenomena like a snail shell
- Everyone wants archi that is 'simple in proportions', and beautiful; the ==Palladio 'Villa Foscari'== is built with 3:4, 4:4, 4:6 proportions (often found in music) and this can be experienced in the villa - not the exact proportions but the idea behind them, of a "noble, firmly integrated composition in which each room presents and ideal form within a greater whole", everything is related in size
- ==[[Le Corbusier]]'s Villa in Garches==: although proportions have been planned, the harsh horizontal and vertical divisions between floors and window panes remove harmony; "Le Corbusier himself has stressed the fact that the house is divided in the ratio 5:8, approximating the golden section, but he has hidden it so well that probably no one who has"
- Study of the human body: "Le Modulor" is Le Corbusier's study of bodily proportions, the ideal height for a man and the proportions of body parts to height giving the golden ratio, have convinced architects of the importance of *height* . Le Corbusier determined 183cm as the ideal/average height, and from this designed his buildings (fearing that increasing height worldwide would increasingly make his buildings small - LOL)
- BUT, simple proportions do not always mean harmonious proportions! By *simplifying* everything, you *lose harmony*
- Employing Le Modulor to design a block in Marseilles:
	- Height of smallest room is 226cm, which is 183cm (ideal height) + lenght of raised arms
	- "The box is divided into innumerable small cells, the apartments, consisting of small rooms with ceiling heights corresponding to the Modulor's raised arms height of 226cm, and larger living rooms double that height"
	- --> extraordinarily low ceilings, narrow and long rooms, cannot be said harmonious
	- Nonetheless, the building gives off a "real greatness" (keeping in mind that this is written in 1960s). "When you stand down there among these fantastic pillars you are made vividly aware that they were created to support a gigantic building" (p. 119). Feeling that it was built for 'giants' before normal people moved in
- Besides wanting to build housing at human scale, what ever this means, there are technical constraints which shape the way homes are built - eg. the way the timber interacts or can be layed alongside bricks, calculating dimensions of material shipped in from elsewhere
- Division between monumental and home architecture: monuments (eg. cathedrals) are built on much larger scales, with incredible materials in their size and weight and value; it isn't the same for domestic buildings, which are much more modest, for obvious practical matters
- Klint working on the Hospital
	- Impossible to make sense of the building by measuring in cms, but everything made sense in feet and inches; he also found that “many of the things we use in daily life were already standardised without our being aware of it. These included bed sheets, table cloths, napkins, plates, glasses…”
	- Furniture is also standardised to the human body
	- Klint’s goal was “to determine, by scientific method, the natural dimensions of architecture and to find out how they could be made to harmonise with each other again - not accordion got any predetermined ratio but by simple division with nothing left over”
-
