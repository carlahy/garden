## notes

The course establishes the basic principles of a humanistic ([[humanities]]) approach to the city, and uses [[cultural theory]] from the 1850s to today in order to understand the city as an **[[urbanity]]**

Setup of the lectures:

I. Topic
II. Urban culture
III. Cultural theory


### (intro) function and signification in modern urban culture

[[Urban culture]] - the object of analysis
[[cultural theory]] - the approach, or tool

#### definitions and dimensions of the concept of culture

What is [[culture]]?
- Widespread word, also in urban planning: **cultural planning** organise their development around art museums, artists, experiences, in order to [[city branding|brand]] the city
- Culture is between art and the everyday (which are not complete opposites)

Aspects of culture: culture as **cultivation, as habit, and as reflexivity**. Culture is all of these concepts at the same time.

1.  **[[cultivation]]** of the soul; from 'soil' to 'soul'
2. **habits**: an important in the [[welfare state]] in Denmark, culture is defined by a social democratic politician as "*culture is habit taken in the most basic sense of the word*"; culture should be for **everybody**, not the few but the many; it isn't something that has nothing to do with the way people live, where you go to a specific place (eg. theatre) to find it; rather, culture is what happens in the mundane everyday life; an **inclusive** point of view
	1. **historical self reflection**: why are habits as they are? they are related to the way we think, socially determined patterns, that could be questioned (eg. why do we sit and the lecturer stands? why do we close the door? these are habits, that can change very easily when reflected upon; eg. during corona, no one was in classroom)
3. **reflexivity**: an artist represents reality with their own interpretations
	1. **Artists** painting in the street: eg. a woman painting in a public square, painting depicts child playing in street, with the Eiffel tower appearing in the back; public urban life is represented

#### roland barthes

*La Tour Eiffel, 1964* 
- The Tower is "a naturalised component in the Parisian cityscape". It has become a way for people to orient themselves.
- It is a particular kind of monumental architecture, an example of modern construction, "built with air", typical of modern times
- Illustrates that architecture serves both as **use and function** , and as **fantasy and imagination**. Eiffel had to defend the tower as 'useful', because modern times were useful, functional times. 
- The Tower is an **abstract form** with attracts a lot of **meaning**. Barthes analyses the Tower as a triangle: 
	- at a **glance**: 'regard', gaze; as if you were climbing the Tower
	- as an **object**: a major example of modern architecture; the function becomes a spectacle (eg. structure built by an engineer, the elevators operate on an oblique line and not directly vertical)
	- as a **symbol**
- This shows the potentials of *signification*
- Space is more than function, it serves as **signification** 

#### humanistic urban studies: the urban dimension

In cities, you live in the midst of what may become your object of study. You are not at a distance from what you are studying, rather, you are embedded in it inevitably (subjectivity?).
So how can you study something you are surrounded by? You cannot have a city as a totality in front of you, because you are inside, so you have to focus on a fragment of it.
There is always an element of interpretation.

Relevant strategies for delimiting an object of study: reconstruction of fragments

Interpretation: a critical strategy in urban culture and societies

## (part 1) perception and lifeworld in copenhagen

### architectural perception and experience in Steen Eiler Rasmussen

The argument: in order to understand, design, improve cities, you have to think about human factors. Things should *work* for people (function), but space must also have a signification (*meaning*). Roland Barthes = architecture is FUNCTION and FANTASY.

#### I. the copenhagen school

Culture is habits taken in the most simple sense of the word. It is not super defined things, nothing flashy. Architecture is an ingredient of our everyday life

[[Steen Eiler Rasmussen]]: the most representative and pedagological of Danish architects. 

Mobilising the amateurs of the lifeworld to the benefit of quality in architecture.
- Critique of modern homes, people being "doomed to live in and gaze upon (houses which) are on the whole without quality"
- Architects should not think of their own ambitions only, but think about the [[habits]] that are widespread amongst the general population

But how is reality? 2 poles:
- **Optical approach**: materialised in tourists constantly taking photos, of what is strange/new/different to you, in order to keep a trace. Consciously looking at built environmnet
- **Tactical approach**: not a focus on the monument itself, but of the everyday practices there, 'habits'; an observation of how people can take monumental architecture and use it in their everyday, and in exchange learn about urban space/built environment around them; *playing* and learning *unconsciously*, feeling the elements without realising
	- eg. observing children playing at the Santa Maria Maggiore church, the photo is of the kids, the steps on the back of the church, and how the space is used in everyday life; not a photo of the monument itself (Rasmussen, p. 16)
	- Experience of the architect/observer: the architect observing and writing an inaccessible experience. "As I sat in the shade watching them, I sensed the whole three-dimensional composition as never before" (p. 17)

Triangular composition: tourist / school children / observer-architect

**Mimetic learning** by repeating what you learn, you transform it and translate it into knowledge that pushes yourself (mind and body) to a new, elevated stage. 
Eg. children playing with a ball against a wall, understanding the composition of the wall through the ball which acts as an extension of your body.


#### II. rasmussen and theory: three spatial principles

Three spatial principles
- **Solids**: "legemer" (body)
- **Voids**: negative forms in the sense that it is empty, but also positive forms that reinforce the architecture. Give a kind of bodily feeling
	- vase or faces?
- **Colour planes**: a depth added to the perspectives of solids and voids; it came into consciousness during time of Rasmussen

eg. the ==Pantheon==, Rome:
- A solid from the outside, a cylindrical volume
- From the inside, the monument is a void "in the most liberal way" insofar as the roof has an opening where the sun and rain come down. A 'pantheist' monument in connection with nature
- Voids are actually present on the outside too - indents and niches in the walls 
- Floor is covered in coloured and patterned planes

eg. ==St. Marc's square== and Basilica, Venice:
- Array of coloured tiles and mosaics on the floors, and stones on the walls

eg. Le Corbusier villa in Paris:
- White and geometric from the outside, expects to be the same inside
- However, inside has an array of colours and rooms with no white (rose floors, light yellow walls, dark brown or blue accent wall...)
- Furniture rooted to the floor (immoveable?)
- Ramp replacing stair cases

From proportion via *scale* to *rhythms*
- Rhythm in space, in human movements

Architecture and human life:
- Architecture can only be understood through the experience of human life. Architecture needs to understand the life style of the people who will use the space (from university to homes), and be determined by who will use the space and how
- *Construction playgrounds*: playgrounds in Denmark with tools and materials for kids to explore with

Architecture as a framework around human living
- It isn't necessary to abandon rectangular forms, we need not get rid of them to support human life; it's easy to move through rectangular rooms and regular forms. 
- *Even if life is chaotic and unpredictable, space doesn't need to be*

### proximity and community in jan gehl, life between buildings

signification and architecture: from Barthes to Rasmussen
- how does architecture come to make sense to people, how is it sensed in the mind and bodies of people in the 20th century? (Rasmussen)

living architecture, living the city?
- how can the city be lived as a social and spatial entity?

moving towards the urban as a [[lifeworld]]

#### jahn gehl on urban culture

In reponse to a disastrous functionalism: reinforcing human presence in urban spaces.

Historic and ideological context of 1960s-70s in which Gehl is developing ideas
- A period where progress is sensed by many
	- Increasing use of cars, people move towards the suburbs (more space, green space) and commute
	- Education is not necessarily linked to social privileges, scholarships are handed out
	- Growth is a 'religious' goal persued without too much reflexion; virtually no one exploring environmental issues (like excessive use of cars)

Gehl has the image of the city as a city of *destruction*
- the Medieval city is closer to what Gehl considers the *ideal city*
- medieval city centered around pedestrians
- people are spread out in space due to division of labour, outdoor activities are spread out
- in the city of functionalism, there is space between buildings in the sprawling city, but *life* between buildings is erased

Experiments of dense and low cities: Tinggaarden and Galgebakken, DK
- Idea is for residential environments to have urban life feel
- Anti-urban life takes over when buildings are so tall that the top floors cannot communicate with the street

Life between buildings is a dimension of architecture, urban design adn city planning to be carefully treated.
The character of the life between buildings changes with *changes in the society* situation, but the essential principles and quality criteria to be used when working for human quality in the public realm have proven to be remarkably constant (2006, p. 7)

Bodily practices of seeing, walking,...

Experience ('oplevelse') after functionalism:
- the scarcity of 'experiences'
- modernity is taking experiences out of ordinary life, and people need to bring experiences - ie., bring people - back to the city

#### small scale design

- Walking, standing, sitting...
- Life should be able to **flow**, buildings should foster **well-being**

### the homosexual form of existence

Series of *sites* where men meet
![[Henning Bech, Where Men Meet#summary of the book]]

**Train stations** are the entry gates to a city, and the city is a *refuge* for homosexuals. 

**Community** is a kind of replacement for the family, and important for people to not be lonely
- The city becomes the landscape because you don't have your own family (families live outside the city, in the suburbs). If you do not have a family, you are *lonely, or anonymous*.
- Sites and aspects of community
	- Pool tables, for example, as a place for gays/lesbians to meet and be in close proximity

**Gay bars** are places where men can exercise their *gaze*, a visual reciprocity between people where consent is communicated. Gazing, visibility, is interesting because it is very un-restricted - it can see in far distances, and cannot (or hardly be) contained. 

Ways of looking at others: from Gehl to Bech, from distraction to feitchisation

Sociologist Georg Simmel *on the gaze as a source of reciprocity and social form*, gaze as the object of sociology (Soziologie, 1908).

**The discotheque** is a concentration point for the *stagings* of the modern gay world, the homosexual existence is altogether a *staged* existence (p. 122). You feel like you are on a stage, and you play your part.
In the 1960s-1970s, the disco is a mainstream culture, whereas homosexual culture is a counter-culture of some kind. Yet they intersect.

Staging and **[[lifeworld]]**

## seminars

### intro seminar

SIGN = SIGNIFIANT / SIGNIFIÉ (signifier/signified)

**Signifier**: what designates the idea of something (eg. 'apple', 'Eiffel Tower', a 'Ford T')
**Signified**: that which the signifier signifies, a meaning, an idea; this can change overtime, metamophasises. It has a *historical* dimension (eg. what an apple means, what the Eiffel Tower represents, what a Ford T entails...)

eg. 'Ford T' designates a car, but used to have a different signification than it does today. It used to *mean* modernity, but now is old fashioned. The *signifier* stayed the same, but the *signified* changed.

A city is always moving, changing, evolving, even if it might look the same, because the built form does not change as fast as society may.


### experiencing architecture, steen eiler rasmussen

#### architecture and the layman

- Understanding architecture vs. experiencing architecture
- Architecture has been elitist, and it is important to include everyday people to a discipline which tends to be *elitist and exclusionary* with a superiority complex
- Treating architecture/buildings as a living being: the perspective of Houyem (architect) and Pepe (layman) in the VUB atrium, Black Diamond
- How elitist is architecture as an art?
	- Eg. music can be classical (more elitist) or pop rock (more casual). Is there the same in architecture?
	- Architecture is probably the most expensive art you can have
	- Copenhagen is a "playground for architects", where rather wild ideas can come to fruition. Eg. Copenhill, an incinerator/energy production plant with a ski lift and climbing wall
- A layman vs. an amateur: the layman becomes an amateur when they invest time, energy, curiosity into observing and analysing architecture (or anything else)
- [[informality]] in architecture
- 

#### human scale vs. dimensions of architecture and public space


Ref. [presentation on human scale and architecture](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KH4BfxA_ULWYbKdpOkx7s2KrNhUJ31uK12zEPc4-xcI/edit?usp=sharing)

### life between buildings, jahn gehl

#### life between buildings: new haven and san salvador

Quality of urban space
- New Haven - seems like the quality is as bad as it could be for public life (wide, empty space, noisy, no human presence besides those who come with their cars specifically...), yet many people gather; so there is another force than urban space quality - a willingness? a tipping point/event? what is it? can low quality public spaces still harbour life?
- eg in San Salvador in the middle of the highway, if food trucks decided to come, would people spend time there, at the fountain/park in the middle of the noisy round about?
- Discussion points
	- *Can urban life still happen in car dominated cities, or does it just happen in a different way?
	- *Do Gehl's principles translate to every context, are they really that logical and obvious?*
	- *Are high quality spaces really necessary for resultant activities?*
	- *Are open shopping malls promoting or inhibiting contact*
- Malls designed by Viennese architect wanting to recreate 'european' walkable streets in a car-centric American which had destroyed these spaces; Gehl took inspiration out of mall design, to relate them to phenomenons observed in (european/danish) city streets

[[Henning Bech, Where Men Meet]]
- why is it that we only mention *men* when it comes to being gay, why are women never mentioned? i understand that from a societial/cultural point of view, the interpretation or stigma may be different, but why never mention women? gaze, cruising isn't a thing for women... why?
