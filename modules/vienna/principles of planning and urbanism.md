5. existence of ruling class, 
6. existence of writing and numbers, 
7. predictive sciences, 
8. existence of artisan class,

10. 'organic solidarity' based on interdependency

## planning the ancient city

#### mesopotamia

One of the earliest urban settlements

#### Greek Urban Planning

**Styles of planning in Ancient Greece**
- old style until 480 BC: "growing together" of earlier settlements, creating irregular layout, but paying attention to views (eg. Olympia, Athens)
- new style until 335 BC: "Hippodamian" style, grid-pattern layout with main streets North-South, strict zoning, plots completely built over, court houses

**Athens**
- Golden Age is short-lived and elusive, but is the first metropolis
- Largest polis with 275,000 inhabitants (citizens, metics, slaces), on 1000sqmi
- Cosmopolitan culture was crucial, a melting pot that arose in connection with trade and colonies
- Precarious agricultural basis, depending on imports
- Poor manufacturing, low esteem of craftsmen
- Exceptional state patronage


**Athen's culture**
- Cumulative innovations, a pioneer in many ways
- Democracy introduced
- Individualism, but also collective and civic goals
- Written history
- Philosophy, rationalism, utilitarianism
- Audiovisuals and drama
- Naturalisatic art
- "Modest" architecture (compared to pyramids), obsessed with correct proportions

**Athens' urban structure**
- Public buildigns, above all: akropolis with Parthenon, Propylaea, etc
- Water pipelines, some sewers, few public baths
- Trading space around agora
- Homes were tiny and primitive, no gardens, but many had court yards
- Socialist minimalist state
- Primitive way of financing, no budget
- Very public life
- Had money for trading

**The rise and fall of Ancient Greece** 
A unique ethnic and cultural melting pot, but the Athenian Golden Age depended on exploitation. There were huge sums of *tribute payments*, it was an *aristocratic* society with abundant time for leisure, and *metics or resident 'aliens' are running the economy* (half inside, half outside mainstream society).

#### Roman Urban Planning

Volterra, Tuscany: an Etruscan city in 7th century BC shows a grid system with large avenues.

Rome's Golden Age lasted 200 years, from 50BCE to 150CE (Before Common Era). It was an unplanned city which gradually improved. The site of Rome was on hills in a flood-prone low-land, and flooding levels were engraved on building walls.

The first priority for such a large city as Rome, was to get rid of the sewage which is a health hasard. *Cloaca Maxima was introduced as the sewer of Rome.

The second priority was water, for which aqueducts were built (first in 312). The system was not water efficient, and the volume of water that flowed was much more than necessary. 14 aqueducts were built, delivering 1 billion litres/day. It flowed continuously because they didn't have proper taps, no water storage, and aqueducts were not pressurised. Since water flowed in the streets, the sidewalks were high and raised pavement stones served as crosswalks.

The third concern was food. Daily food doles were distributed, pork and 1.4kg of bread. 

Infrastructures like the forum, Colosseum and city walls were built and expanded under different emperors. 

Housing was socially mixed, and to accommodate the population growth, buildings were built wit additional stories (from 3 stories in 3rd century BCE to 5 stories in 1st century BCE). These constructions became unstable due to the additional weight, even though they were built from solid brick.

Residential buildings had an enclosed patio. The ground floor had shops and storage rooms, and people lived above.

The city is noisy, dark at night, and polluted.

##### Pompeii
An unplanned old town, and a planned new city. They had the same raised sidewalks and crossing stones to avoid the flowing water, housing with atriums.

##### Novaesium, a Legion's Camp

Novaesium, or Neuss, is a city in North-Rhine-Westphalia near Düsseldorf, with many Roman sites.

The camps had exactly the same layout so that soldiers would always find their way around. There were regulations on where and how bathrooms, for eg., should be built.

They were built on elevated grounds to avoid flooding like in Rome. They were built along the Danube (from the Rhine, down to the Black sea) which created a boundary. 

Outside the camp, there were civilian settlements around, which ca be seen in Vienna's city centre.  

##### Ancient cities in contemporary knowledge
  
What is the point of this knowledge nowadays? Tourism and events, but also urban imaginaries. Knowledge is being recycled to create importance and awareness in the city.

## planning the medieval city

#### From the Roman Empire to the Middle Ages
The Dark Ages lasted between 500-1000 AD, and was a period of time between the Roman Empire and the Middle Ages. During the Dark Ages, much of the former powers disappeared (the Roman Empire disintegrated, which cut off trade routes and information flows except for the oriental merchants (Orient = non-Latin speaking), technologies were lost, cities shrank and disappeared (eg. Trier, Cologne, Avenches). 

#### Early Middle Ages

The "Ancient World" was fragmented into islands of small-scale, manorial feudalism, protected by fortifications and castles (eg. Tower of London, Ljubljana castle) $\rightarrow$ shrinkage

The manor was an economic, judicial, military unit

#### High Middle Ages
Cities in the High Middle Ages have 6 origins:

1.  **Rebuilding on top of, and with, Roman remains**. They were former Roman cities, blossoming again as residences of Emperors (Aachen), Archbishops (Trier, Regensburg, Cologne) and Dukes (Vienna)

1.  **Monastery settlements** with Bishop's seat (Bamberg, Kaptol)

1.  **Castles of the Principality** (bourg) combined with settlement for craftsmen and merchants (faubourg, portus, Graz)

1.  **Commercial settlements** of free merchants and craftsmen, developed from wik settlements (merchant settlements), Germanic-Slavic origins

1.  Free manors and **Market-towns (Ackerbürgerstädte)

1.  Newly-founded **mining towns**, based on better knowledge of where coal, gold, may be found (Frankenberg, Sachsen, Freiberg (DE), Banska Stiavnica (Slovakia)...)

#### Characteristics of Medieval Cities

- City walls date from the Middle Ages, to protect against barbaric attacks, and a castle located higher on a hill
- Ditches around the city (graben)
- Narrow streets with burgher houses
- Church (goes without saying, a Christian endeavour)
- Central market square, need to feed the growing population

Almost all European cities date from the High Middle Ages, and European city tourism is exploiting these legacies.

##### High Medieval City

*ref. Vance chapter 4

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]leading_cities_1500

There is an upswing around 1200 AD (eg. Notre Dame 1163-1345). New Towns are founded and Ancient Towns are renewed. There is a strict separation of urban and rural functions (ref. Max Weber). There are two types of urban places:

-  Natural settlements: local market based central places, and
-  Systemic settlements: long distance trade based, with varying degree of freedom from Feudal powers

There are two hearths of Medieval urbanism, Flanders and North Italy (Po Basin and Tuscany). Flanders and North Italy are "trade-originating Europe'', with systematic settlements, and the rest is "trade-supporting Europe'' with natural settlements that depend on their role as central places.

Until today, both functions are important for a city to prosper: its role as a shopping and service centre for its region, and its "global city''-ness, based on its worldwide connectivity in services and goods.

There are two basic types of architecture:

-  Mediterranean: uninterrupted urban tradition
-  North of the Alps: new foundations and many new settlers

Unlike the ancient city, housing combines work and home due to a scarcity of space in the Medieval City. The houses are narrow burgher house-shops, or even house-towers built from local materials (stone, timber, adobe, studwork).

Conflicts between factions meant that structures like house-towers were built.

##### Mediterranean City

Remains of previous architecture can be traded as vernacular architecture (concerned with domestic and functional, and not public and monumental). Places like amphitheatres are recycled, along with their building materials.  

The Mediterranean city is a city of **factions** (house towers of Bologna, Lucca). It is a mix of Renaissance palaces, earliest tenement houses and individual houses, many arcades.

The Black Death pandemics (1348) more than halves the population of cities. 

##### North of the Alps

The city North of the Alps is a city of **guilds**. 

There are no City-States bordering each other, but (temporarily) Free Cities surrounded by feudal countryside. There is a stark contrast between urban and rural society.

There are two settlement systems, "central-place'' and "mercantile''. There's functional segregation based on guilds (unlike Mediterranean cities of factions).

Merchants are clustering at "portus'' and then expanding.

The nobility still remains in their countryside castles (unlike Mediterranean cities where the nobility returned earlier). 

Tall house-shops, on narrow burgage plots, within tight city walls, catering for an extended family (including apprentices and journeymen).

"Quarters of Tolerance" for the outsiders like merchants, students...

#### Timeline of Medieval Cities

Similar to Ancient cities, from "geomorphic'' unplanned cities (type 1), evolving into more and more "geometric'' for newly-founded planned cities, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe.

1.  Unplanned cities (1100 AD)
2. Rebirth of the planned city
3. Zähringer's cross-shaped market towns
4. Towns with long market-streets
5. Towns with ladder-type streets
6. Rebirth of the grid city
7. The grid-shaped town (13th century)

## renaissance: planning the absolutist city

15th-16th century

Renaissance marks the transition between middle ages to modernity in 15th-16th century. A period of demographic and economic recovery after Black Death pandemic. Royal powers consolidated and absolutist regimes emerge. Medieval localism is replaced by Baroque centralism, focusing on capital/residential cities of unifying states. Beginning of colonial empires.

There are no Renaissance cities, only ideal designs, absolutist cities grow to sizes far beyond Medieval cities. Origins of office buildings and tenement housing. Military innovations involve engineers in fortified city planning; walled cities cannot expand horizontally, only in height and density

#### ideal cities

Architectural proposals for ideal cities, safe, that were never built. 

For example, Leonardo suggested underground goods transport by boat (although waters were contaminated), and street level pedestrian streets.
Schonbrün looks south.

#### fortification towns

Fortress city
- defortification of old fortress city of Vienna (walls removed in 1857 after reluctant Emperor's approval) 

#### baroque

baroque, renaissance
- Praterstern, en étoile
- baroque zoo of Vienna

## early capitalism: industrial city miseries, early reforms

Previously, cities were not built for industries but for handicrafts (eg. vineyards in Vienna). 
Industrial is an era with little urban planning.

#### manchester
*Hall chapter 10*
- Presents the industrial history but not so much urbanism
- ~1835: first and greatest industrial city of the world
- Raw materials: water, coal, iron, lime, salt, stone
- Possible reasons:
	- proto-industrialisation
	- networking
	- dissenting small entrepreneurs
	- combining textile and clockmaking traditions
	- polytechnic education- specialised schools
	- first innovative milieu
- Economic Freedom: granted since Weaver's act of 1558, attracting foreigners and Protestant refugees
- Putting-out system originally, drawn into vertical integration
- Innovations (1700s): flying shuttle, spinning by rollers, carding machine, jenny

*Friedrich Engels, 1820-1895*
- Originally pubilshed *Condition of the Working Class in England (1845)* originally in German and banned in English
- Observes deplorable living conditions in English cities: 
	- death from starvation
	- bad sanitary conditions (cholera pandemic)
	- slums: separate territories assigned to poverty, removed from the sight of happier classes
	- 50k homeless in London
	- dense and centralised population
- Strong element of Irish immigrants and of Irish extraction
- Outnumbering of workers to bourgeoisie 2:1, even 3-4:1 $\rightarrow$ how was such a society upheld if bourgeoisie was so outnumbered?
- Planning
	- Bad and irregular courts, lanes, back alleys. Manchester as a city **unprepared for new industry**
	- **Back to back housing**: new and efficient housing model (no through aeration), first urbanistic answer in industrial city
	- British Health Act (1848): first attempt at regulating the industriual city
		1.  Sewage and drainage
		2. Refuse removal
		3. Sanitary conditions
		4. Slaighterhouse regulations
		5. Ventilation and hygiene of tenement housing
		6. Street pavement and maintenance
		7. Public gardens and parks
		8. Water supply
		9. Funderal services
		10. Specific taxes and levies
- Prison reforms
- Poor Law Reforms
- Public Health Act
- Private philanthropist reforms: eg. privately built garden cities/settlements, Familistere, Port Sunlight


*$\Rightarrow$ Cities were not prepared for influx of people and industries $\rightarrow$ **no planning yet*** 

#### philanthropist reforms
Private investments into housing and social conditions, eg. Familistere or Bournville, 'utopias'

#### Glasgow
- A city on the European periphery, not even a sea-port
- 1765: James Watt invents the steam engine, upgrading earlier machinery; steam-driven, to be regulated; originally used for pumping water in mines, then in steam mills
- Glasgow benefits from emerging Trans-Atlantic economy
- Coal and iron deposits nearby, made accessible after 1801
- Steam boats first tried on inland waters, both in US and UK
- Firms have welfare programmes, ==including housing==
- 1888 and 1901: International exhibitions take place in Glasgow

#### tenement housing
- Paris
- New York: thin and high housing
- Pure grid pattern planning without facilities (eg. toilets or running water)

## urban engineering and fin de siècle urbanism
Urban planning type I, the beginning of "planning as we know it"

The beginning of serious urban planning, focusing on massive infrastructure to make cities safe $\rightarrow$ **averting risks or adaptation planning**

#### urban planning types
Phases of Planning Cultures
1. Adaptation planning (anpassungsplanung)
2. Catchment planning (Auffangplanung)
3. Innovation planning (Entwicklungsplanung)
4. Perspective planning (Perspektivplanung)
5. New phase: sustainability planning

Administrative and engineering challenge arose when Vienna expanded in the 20th century. Only on top of a technical foundation was Red Vienna possible (eg. all the social housing, kindergartens...).

Vienna- stages of incorporation, 1850-1910
te

**Building codes**
- Minimum width as to not be able to touch both sides of housing with armspan; medieval buildings can stay but new construction must follow width guidelines
- Grid pattern
	- Streets must be "as straight as possible"
	- Grid originated in New York City and became a planning norm
	- In Vienna, see the outer ring neighbourhoods: new housing in outer districts (10th, 16th...) built in strict grids 

**Risk aversion**
- Flooding preventions for the Donau: building kanal, diverting and closing streams

![[Vienna- grid pattern.png]]



**Defortification**
- defortification was delayed in Vienna, which means it could be done in a well thought-out way
- Vienna organised an urban planning competition, and a committee voted on the best solution by combining suggestions

**Technical infrastructures (and some beautification)**
- Height zoning
- Outer suburbs incorporated
- Trees planted along boulevards
- Electricity in the homes
- Gas lights in the streets
- Bridges for metropolitan rail road
- Electric street-cars
- Granite pavements (7x7x7 inch pavement stones)
- New sewers

**Tenement housing**
- Luxury tenement housing ("plalace") opened on Ringstrasse opposite the opera #ringstrasse
- Buildings built in different styles (neo-gothic, neo-baroque, neo-renaissance (eg. University in neo-renaissance represents the rise of learning/knowledge))

**Transporting ideas, technologies, patents**
- Theophil Hansen inspired by Athens to recycle ancient architectural styles in Vienna (ref. starchitects)
- World exhibitions as mega-events and drivers of innovations
	- London 1851, 1862 - Paris 1855, 1867 - Vienna 1873
	- Countries exhibiting innovations, eg. corrugated iron that can be wrapped around material and be used to make secure shutters to shut shops at night

**Engineering with *beautification***
- City parks- it was clear that cities could not be built over completely
	- Ringstrasse planned for parks (Rathaus, Volksgarten, Augarten, Stadtpark...) #ringstrasse
	- Standardised public toilets- should look nice, eg. steel framed pissoir
- Improving the design of the Ringstrasse #ringstrasse 
	- Camillo Sitte: idea to divide the street into multiple sectors so that traffic could be interrupted vs...
	- Otto Wagner: designing new 22nd district of Vienna; grid district design with 30k buildings to house 150k inhabitants; tall and imposing architecture, which Camillo Sitte was against
	- What is beautiful? naked technical necessity vs. iconic buildings

**Reserve areas**
- Otto Wagner hospital was built on the outskirts of the city, in anticipation for the expected 4 million residents mid-20th century

## reformist urbanism (pre WWII)
1920s-1930s

4 typical movements and policies $\rightarrow$ garden cities; settlers' movement; public and social housing; zoning; regional planning

The ills of the industrial city and urbanisation should be alleviated by separating the uses (ref. Athens Charter published by Le Corbusier, describing the Ville Radieuse).
Cities are growing and urbanising, we need some organisation $\rightarrow$ conurbation
Reconfiguration of places and borders

**Political and scientific framing of reformist urbanism**
*In the 1920s*
- Democracy arrives- general coting rights instead of graded voting rights (according to income and wealth)
- Goal of "urban order" replaces/supersedes pure safety goals
- Origin of social welfare administration- qualitative improvement of 
	- education- abundance of new teaching material, books, graphics, cartography, new ambition to visualise things
	- health system
	- social work- upgrading and ambitious, eg. orphenage homes
- Parallel to garden city and settlers' movement, first phase of social housing, zoning replaces set-back (alignment) plans, beginning regional planning (US, GB, DE)
- Scientific method and belief in prognosis
- Democratic participation formally granted

#### garden cities
- 1904- first garden city established in Letchworth, north of London, terraced houses with shops on the main streets, supposed to be a solution to mass housing, considered successful; 1901- Hampstead garden suburb established
- Garden cities materialised in many 'new towns' in the UK
- Idea internationalises- garden city association organises meetings and conferences across the channel
	- 1894-1904- Madrid, Ciudad Lineal, low rise housing
	- 1908-19130- Dresden, Germany's first garden suburb of Hellerau,
	- 1912- Essen, garden village of Margarethenhöhe built by philanthropist
	- ... many more- cités jardins in Paris, social democrat build state-run garden cities in Frankfurt...

#### settlers' movement
- **Settlers movement** coming out of post-war economy created allotment gardens -> people were given land to grow food for themselves, there were no plans (ie. legalisation on shanti towns); **subsistence wartime economy**; people stayed on the allotments, creating more substantial houses
- Became a cooperative, grass-roots movement, progressively overtaken by public housing
- Otto Wagner hospital area (1910)- upgarded allotment gardens in suburbs into 'spontaneous' housing established by the people (~1910s-20s), contrast to 1930s garden settlements, more organised, led by the city council $\rightarrow$ in a brief period of <30 years, three planning styles manifest - hospital vs. allotment gardens vs. garden settlements

#### public and social housing

Housing problems during WWI
- No more **housing investment** (opposite from today, where investment/private market is huge driver of housing landscape)
- Collapse of new housing finance, but hyper-inflation destroyed value of loans
- Rapid rent increases resisted by tenants, because of **unregulated rental market** led to the rent freeze in 1917
- Large urban industrial centers particularly affected
- Housing problems also in rural areas with war industry

Public/social housing fostered by nationalist socialist authoritarian government, who wanted to safely house workers for the war effort; not keen on high rise because easy target when engaged in war

Ways of **regulating the [[housing market]]**
- Rent control in form of rent freeze
- Social housing
- Today in Vienna, the **private market is smaller than social housing** sector, due to:
	- Merging former small rented apartments to bigger apartments fit to contemporary uses (reverse of subdivision)
	- Same number of people living in Vienna in 2020 as in 1910 - where did these people live before when there were 500k dwellings? 4 people lived per dwelling on average, compared to today with 2 people in much more spacious dwelling $\rightarrow$ increasing prosperity, reduction in household sizes

[[social housing|Social housing]] is an **upgrade** from [[tenement housing]]:
- Inner court yards and more green spaces 
- Kindergartens built in to the housing complex


![[Vienna_housing_sub_markets.png]]

Start of social housing in Vienna from 1918 to 1939, signfiicantly slowing during WWII but starting again post-WWII when economy picks up

![[vienna_housing_builds.png]]

#### urban planning type 2: zoning

[[zoning|Zoning]] is something new in Vienna and in other European cities, but was in the making in previous phases of urban planning. In previous plans for Vienna (ie. urban engineering phase) we can see this in the areas delimited as parks or industrial areas.

The aim of zoning is to control the use of plots, and zoning the city is a long process.

- **Height regulations** $\rightarrow$ inhibits high-rise buildings, but allows most kind of **land-use** within height and street width limits
	- 1829: explicit height regulations, 5 storeys
	- 1859: regulation of 25 meters 
	- 1893: concentric height limitations established, special zones for heavy industry (Bauzonenplan)
- **Green Belt** around Vienna defined in 1905 (green zones)
- **Industrial building zones** (blue zones)
- 1916: zoning is an innovation in NYC
- Regulations on **permitted land-use** detailed in 1929 Vienna building code: ****
	- Height and width regulations
	- Mixed [[land use]] is incrementally reduced over decades
- 1930s: first **high-rises** permitted in most European cities

![[Vienna_zoning_plan.png]]

#### beginnings of regional planning

**Incorporation**
- Limits to continuing incorporation (explanding the borders of the city to wider and wider territory), because of resistance from people (19th century)
- "Conurbation" and "survey before plan"
- Greater London: 
	- Proposed: orbital parkways, satellite/garden cities
	- Greater London plan: road hierarchy (A-E ring roads), neighbourhood principle, green belt, 8 New Towns
- Berlin: incorporation stopped in 1861, "Greater Berlin Planning" competition in 1910 led to incorporation of Gross-Berlin in 1920
- 
**Regional planning**
- Need for **regional planning** to:
	- Link recreation areas
	- Need to link transport systems (eg. highways)
- Regional planning started at the same time as when the **suburban move** started
- How to **coordinate** these urban regions? (core and outer regions?) There are bodies who...
	- Coordinate transport systems $\rightarrow$ *verkersverbung* traffic organisation which combines tickets and timetables for suburban trains
	- Coordinate recreational areas $\rightarrow$ try to attract recreational parts of the region so people stay within the region

Vienna's urban region: 
- **Core** (orange)
- **Outer zone** (blue): where 30% of workforce travel to Vienna core to work; travel-to-work area
	- Putting pressure on transport logistics in the inner city
- Contiguous settlement from core to outer zones, doesn't look 'rural'
- The central conurbation is larger than city

![[vienna_connurbation.png]]


## modernist urbanism (post WWII)

*Framed by a variety of welfare regimes, emerging after 1945, under both capitalism and socialism*

Post-WWII, planning has been reconstructed with new democratic times, and is infused with economic and social policies. The welfare state develops post-1945 and was not there before, as such priorities/focus shifts from reformist urbanism.

#### concepts from reformist urbanism

Many ideas from the inter-war Reformist period (1920s-30s) gain momentum after WWII.
What happened to garden cities, social housing, zoning and regional planning after 1945?

**new towns and garden cities**
- New Towns and Garden Cities are run by the State (eg. in UK, Vienna)
- How should cities destroyed after WWII be rebuilt?
	- Debate on **housing density**: high rises vs. low rise; what is most economical? very dense medium-rise?
	- Low rise requires more land that spills into rural areas, single houses need significant distance to neighbourhoods

![[building_density_debate.png]]

**social housing
- After WWII there was a consensus across political party on social housing (historical comprise!)
- *Mass production* of good quality social housing/council housing; standards are simply, but improve over time (size, bathroom, central heating, even saunas/pools)
- The "*golden age*" of social housing peaking in early 1970s (DE/AU), which extended to be the major force of housing supply in some countries (eg. Netherlands), until social housing was sold off and transformed into market supply (not in all countries, there are places of resistance!) due to neoliberalism
	- 1970s: over production and lack of demand! (DE/AU)
- Rent liberalisation (rent control phased out) starting in ~1960s
- Public subsidies distributed for
	- Private construction, State contributes to paying morgage (aide à la pierre)
	- Production subsidies, State offered morgages, people repaid the State, ie. outside banking system (aide à la pierre)

**zoning**
- Continued, improved, and extended to the whole urban area
- First was only about height/width, not about land-use, but gradually changed in inter-war period to include land-use regulation
- What type of uses should be allowed next to each other? Careful planning done
- The end of **mixed zoning**
- Zoning is a continuous process, every 10-12 years in Vienna zoning is reviewed
 
**regional planning**
- It is necessary to plan beyond the city limits
- But, in democratic times there is strong *resistance* to incorporation. Thus, regional planning remains rare and difficult in urban agglomerations
- But it is needed, so other planning idea is required: 
	- eg. coordinating cycling paths, public transport systems (with uniform tarrif system), planning recreational/protected areas

#### new frameworks in post-1945 era

New frameworks in the post-1945 era

- **Nation states** 
	- Becoming ambitious, the state steps in to build basic heavy industry as a precondition to economic growth
	- States embarque in the supply of health system, social security coverage, etc.
	- Most welfare policies/frameworks are a result of this post-war redesign
- **Stages of urbanisation**
	- Urbanisation/suburbanisation/deurbanisation/reurbanisation are forces which have to be tamed and managed by urban planners
- **Socialist/post-socialist urbanism**
	- Political systems impact on urban development
	- Plan communist economies of USSR produced "tamed" cities, produced urbanisation and not suburbanisation (which arrived in 1990s with capitalist system)

**Urban social policies**
- 19th century: limited social policies; insurance only for elite social groups
- 20th century: emergence of urban social policies, introduced by pioneer welfare cities/states
	- Inter-war pioneering systems: includes health, education, housing system before it popularised post-war
	- Post-war: new type of welfare regime/capitalism, as a system to organise social services; impinges on housing and planning
- Peak/decline of welfare policies
	- Housing welfare regime peak in 1970s, b/c of over supply
	- Empty hospital beds become debate

**Urban economic policy**
- 19th century: urban economic policy non-existant or laissez-faire, investors could do what they wanted and State allowed major works
- 20th century:
	- 1920s: private supply of infrastructure questionned at end of liberal era; people became aware to private supply of elementary infrasturcture (eg. gas) was problematic because it was not efficient, cheap or reliable (eg. explosions, not always working, investors withdrew...)
	-  1945+: State focused on rebuilding heavy industry for economic growth; controlled by state in many countries (France, Italy, Austria had national gas and metal industries)
	- 1970s: State sells off parts of industry but States are also busy in attracting private investors, so they set up locational agencies and policies to attract investments or political institutions
		- UN city in Vienna to attract political institutions during Cold War
	- Today: neoliberalism, importance of world wide competition with investors, attracting tourists, etc.

#### welfare and housing regimes
In old planning interventions, planning was a technical task, done by civil engineers/experts removed from the city (eg. sewage, electricity, public transport systems, flood protection...)
Some interventions were shortsighted and had to be improved shortly after. 
There weren't many links with **social policy**, except maybe social hospitals (which is also technical) but there were no social housing, for example. 

In 1920s in the post-war period, planners broadened field of intervention from purely technical (which already included beautification) to broader social policies. Emergence of schools, kindergartens, health and social institutions, social housing... 

Post WWII, the nationalisation of different sectors and the abolition of strict national borders, led to the blossoming of ideas (?). The "melting away of boxes" (ie. strict nations) created a European-wide and global competition, making variations of the welfare state more difficult.

Move towards post-socialist society, but there is an echo effect: old social housing (even the housing stock sold to private tenants), district heating, still exist. The built fabric still exists even if doesn't belong to/maintained by the state.

This shows that history is relevant for understanding modernist urbanism and onwards.

***WELFARE REGIMES***

3 regimes organising their welfare systems different:
1. **Liberal regime**, centered upon market supply
2. **Social democratic regime**, centered upon state supply
3. **Conservative regime**, centered upon extended family supply (particularly path-dependent)

Welfare regimes geographically positioned in Europe:
![[welfare_regimes_europe.png]]
- These three points can be applied to health care, housing organisations...

***HOUSING REGIMES***
- 2 diverging thoughts: unitary and dualist systems
- **Unitary**: there is overlap between social and private system of housing; social housing has enough influence to indirectly regulate private market price, because market cannot be attractive if price is too high
- **Dualist**: free rental market, where private can ask as much as it wants; those who cannot afford (the very poor) there is a residual housing system with very low rents set by legislation, nothing to do with the market values; "either or"

#### stages of urban development
- Phases of urban development look different in cities across Europe: **urbanisation, suburbanisation, desuburbanisation, reurbanisation**
- Function urban region has two elements:
	- **Core**, the contiguous built-up area
		- How is the core defined? City borders?
		- But to be comparable, cities across world need to define "city limits" in the same way 
		- Can do this by looking at built form and find the cut-off of continuous settlement, eg. no more than X meters between settlements
	- **Ring**, the commuter belt
		- Originally small, population declined (until [[suburbanisation]], used only by elite with summer-time villas outside city or by shop-keepers and servants commuting into core; 
- Population development over time in urban cores and rings; rate of growth/decline:
![[urban_planning_dynamics_urban_growth.png]]

- **Suburbanisation**
	- In Austria, suburbanisation started in the 1960s, with arrival of volkswage
	- In central-European cities like Prague, Brno, started much later (2000s)


..... ==ref slides on population changes.... can't stand it anymore at this point== 

#### socialist and post-socialist urbanism

- How cities are developing is nfluenced by political systems around it

(NOT AT CORE OF COURSE?)

Key elements of [[post-socialism|post-socialist]] city (Sonia Hirt, 2013): 

- **Overall spatial articulation**
	- Sharp edges of formerly compact cities are eroded
	- Suburban sprawl exceeding western suburbanisation
	- Forests and farmland around cities built over
- **Scale of urban development**
	- End of spatial generosity
	- Building projects much smaller
	- Building on once public and green space
	- EU members benefit from EU funding 
- **Functional balance**
	- Huge share of socialist industrial land
	- Vast brown fields to be converted
	- Retail revolution, new kiosks, shopping malls, until saturation
- **Building typologies**
	- Segregation on the rise
	- Single family homes, gated communities in suburbs
	- Information settlements sprawling 
- **Urban aesthetics**
	- End of grayness, boredom, uniformity
	- Eclectic mix retro/ethno architecture
	- Copy-paste of western models
	- Investor-led urban planning

##  urban development planning
$\rightarrow$ urban planning type III

A period after the reconstruction post-WWII, in the 1960s-1980s. The comprehensive plannings come to an end and are superseeded by these urban plans.

The urban development plans are focused on planning per se, but this instrument is embedded in a broader, fully-developed national welfare state (not the embrionic welfare city of the 1920s, but on the state level). They are later resized in scope

Try to coordinate multitude of investments, look at the whole city, and don't refrain from steering the market. They are setting up private loan companies, from the city, who are making money/doing business.

Planning for:
- coordinated developments
- coordinating public actors
- comprehensive, area-wide, project oriented
- influencing markets

Using [[urban development]] plans as a tool. 
Emerge in the 1960s-70s, the plans have many ambitions, a 'super zoning' tool to try to steer everything in the city that can relate to urban interests.

Planning in a systematic way comes from **project management**, a tool to plan everything from individual building to urban development planning --> transported into the whole city

### the golden age of welfare

Sweden is poor in the 1970s, late industrialisation and urbanisation, 1.25 million emigrants to the US. 
Pensions introduced early on, before WWI - so, it has some **Bismarckian** rules, ie. early welfare state systems, introduced 100 years before the comprehensive welfare state of post WWII era.
First nation state where Social Democracy entered government
Financed by high taxes, developed a high-quality welfare system (kindergardens, housing, health care, etc.)

#### housing welfare

**Sweden housing welfare**
- Important social element of post-war Sweden
- Pre-WWII: poor housing quality, 
- 1930s: state housing loans
- 1946: housing policy package, considered a pillar of the welfare state
- 1946-1980: 87% of housing construction is state-subsidised
- 1945-1975: majority housing is public, followed by private and coop
- 1980s: Sweden is leader in housing budget (3.9% GDP), declined since (2% GDP in 2000)
- Public land banking meant the land cost was very low
- 1942-1969: rent control, locally negotiated afterwards

Housing is a pillar of social state, but not only a social policy: also a regional policy (steer in what direction developments take place), an energy policy, an economic policy (housing determines where jobs)

**Housing subsidies**
- Direct housing subsidies: reduced rents and housing costs, direct investments from government into housing stock; aide a la pierre, ie. subsidising cost of building dwellings
- Some countries have indirect housing subsidies, for example giving **tax cuts/rebates**  (eg. Germany, Sweden, has done this)

**Market-state mixes in housing provision**
- Liberal cluster (UK, Ireland, Switzerland): builders deriving profits from land speculation

![[imgs/housing_welfare_state_market_mixes.png]]

**Sweden development plans**
- Stockholm's development plans were ambitious for the time, embedded in the 1920s reforms;
- 1928: general plan, from reformist government, suggesting an underground plan
- 1945: war time boosted comprehensive planning, and new master plan for Stockholm was decided
- 1952: general plan, proposes new susurban districts for 10-15k inhabitants each, along subway stops
- 1950s: opening of subways, earlier than most European expansions
- 1960s: huge vacant areas in the city centre; becoming renowned amongst modernist planners
	- Pedestrian/cycling bridges over car roads
	- Escalators in open air
- Redevelopment of city centre (from run down "slum" )
- Satellite towns: increasing opposition because of overproduction of standardised prefab dwellings, increasing vacancies, and immigrants move in 


==> In golden years of welfare, state takes the task of urban renewals, not private investors; this is the case in many cities, beginnings of urban renewal is state led, and only later investors take over and develop luxurious infrastructure in the city centre.

#### urban development planning

- The tool for the time of the "golden age" of the welfare state
- ==coordination==
- **Urban development plan**: a massive, all embracing documents to guide development
	- 1984: Vienna's first urban development plan
- Idea isn't that other tools aren't in use anymore, but that there is a *new* tool (think of tools as staircase, accumulating, rather than replacement)
- This type of planning came to an end because many plans didn't become reality
	- eg. "finger plans" (eg. in Copenhagen) predicting that populations will grow along linear 'fingers', which hasn't materialised; in reality grew between fingers
- Need to **collaborate** with external organisations who are infringing on urban planning like never before 
	- eg. Droitwich, Worcestershire: government departments, county and borough departments, appointed agencies, private enterprises, community interests
- Technocrats in expanded definition of the term
- Goal is to maximise choice in welfare supply: public *and*  private transport, subway *and* highway
- Reintroducing more mixed zoning
....

City developments
- high rise buildings appear in 70s, strong integration with urban development plannings because require agreement of cities. Preconditions to high-rises are superb public-transport location


#### mass social housing


#### state driven urban renewal
- state created historic preservation zones (nothing can be done without approval of "heritage patrol"), lowered densities in certain districts, introduced parking management

## urban governance & collaborative planning
$\rightarrow$ urban planning type IV
*the neoliberal city and its limits*

Period from 1990s to today

Many names for this period of planning, urban governance and collaborative planning but also:
- **Commodified cities in competition**
- The market economy plays an increased role in planning, compared to during the welfare states of the past; state not longer plays the Leviathan role it used to, its role is more modest, but nonetheless still there. The pandemic has led to a resurgence of the state

Main themes:
- **Restructuring** and resistence
- **Commodification** of urban development since the 1980s
- **EU** integration and enlargement
- European cities in **competition**
- Urban **entrepreneurialism**: rban entrepreneurs making use of dense networks of cities for tourism and attraction of new classes
- Mega-events: tradition from world exhibition rebranded into eg. cultural capitals, sports events kicking off projects
- Project planning: working with investors for the development of complex projects (eg. Seestadt Aspern), on a much bigger scale and complexity than in previous chapter (Urban Development Plans)
- The challenge of social cohesion and sustainability
- Urban imagineering and **branding**: what ideas of cities are transported, enhanced or reduced, with the help of media and social media

**6 stages of planning** in Vienna (Suitner)
![[urban_planning_stages_vienna.png]]

**Projects**
- based on strategic projects, selective deregulation through urban development corporations and PPP contracts
- Planning is locally focused on one area, and thus pays less attention to the rest of the urban area.

**ASID**
- Agency, Structure, Institutions, Discourse;

#### collaborative
- Increasing collaboration between markets, states and individuals --> many **perspectives**. The number of relevant actors are increasing, as well as interactions and complexity.
- Where is the welfare triangle??

![[urban_planning_collaboration_actors.png]]


**Many names** for collaborative planning: communicative, negotiation, strategic, project planning...

#### welfare restructuring/retrenchment

The golden age of welfare is over, states become more greedy and distributes benefits only after proof of need, and these requirements are more and more restrictive.

#### negative Characteristics of planning culture
- More secrecy and **less democracy**, elete-drive priorities
- Growth coalitions, growth machines, 
- Shift from **social to economic** policy
- Selective **deregulation** (eg. urban development corporations, PPP contract planning)
- Flagship projects (eg. Donau-City, Seestadt, IBA in Vienna)
- National and/or EU co-funding or large urban projects
-  Sustainability as a buzzword, but present in every planning document, ("circular city")
- "Smart city" 

#### entrepreneurialism
- Harvey 1989
- an emerging type of urban governance, in which comprehensive urban development planning is taken over by planned urban "fragments"
- Inter-urban competition reduces relative autonomy of local states, fosters growth coalitions/machines and PPPs, and competition regulations make it necessary to enter in EU/global market
- Urban entrepreneurs are making use of dense networks of cities for tourism and attraction of new classes, and urban spectacles are important

#### Growth machines and pro-growth coalitions
- Broad consensus on growth in US
- Boosterism in 19th century: railways (1950s), highways driven by 'town boosters', often bankers and real estate agents
- Today: more subtle and complex strategies, less by individuals than institutions
- income of local authorities is dependent on local population, because real estate can be taxed. Thus, it is in city governments' interest to attract businesses and wealthy inhabitants, which feed local government funds - this is referred to as growth machines, local boosterism.
- Importance of press and information offices


- Cultural events instrumentalised (eg. St Patricks Day, xmas markets, NYE concerts), urban **marketing and branding**
- Urban media carry symbolic policy (eg. crime rates, quality of life, financially important decisions receiving less attention)
- Growth coalitions include not only local business but also politicians, local media, urban services, universities, cultural institutions
- **Visionary "plans"** instead of urban development plans

#### visionary plans
- Include phrases like: vision, strategic pprojects, PPP, knowledge clusters, synergies, social balance, equality of life changes, balance cooperation/competition, sustainability, best practice of urban technology, clusters of bio/medical technology
- In Vienna: 'zielgebiete' as imprecise project areas where investments should go into


#### festivalisation of urban planning
- A way to show-off plans and projects (eg. Donau-Insel, Seestadt...)
- eg. Seestadt opening in June 2010, with no connecting metro and no buildings; an event to create enthusiasm in the project


#### Summary of Urban Planning Type IV:
- Urban governance, Collaborative planning
- Welfare restructuring/retrenchment
- Neoliberalisation, Commodification, Financialisation
- Entrepreneurialism
- Starchitects, project planning
- Mega-events
- Festivalisation
- Urban branding and urban imagineering
- Sustainability


## planning the sustainable city
$\rightarrow$ urban planning type V


## readings

### Schorske, *The Ringstrasse, its critics and the birth of urban modernism*,  (1980)
- Two considerations:
	1. "the Ringstrasse itself as a visual expression of the values of a social class" (p. 25), planning projecting of values into space
	2.  "undramatic technical work" that provided health and safety for growing Viennese population, thanks to the liberal political environment - eg. hospitals, public health system, Danube regulation to prevent floods, parks, utilities, public services... BUT not yet the social/low cost housing that Vienna is famous for
