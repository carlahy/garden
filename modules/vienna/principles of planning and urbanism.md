### planning the ancient city

#### Greek Urban Planning

...

#### Roman Urban Planning
*March 15th 2022*

Volterra, Tuscany: an Etruscan city in 7th century BC shows a grid system with large avenues.

Rome's Golden Age lasted 200 years, from 50BCE to 150CE\alignedmarginpar(Before) Common Era. It was an unplanned city which gradually improved. The site of Rome was on hills in a flood-prone low-land, and flooding levels were engraved on building walls.

The first priority for such a large city as Rome, was to get rid of the sewage which is a health hasard. *Cloaca Maxima was introduced as the sewer of Rome.

The second priority was water, for which aqueducts were built (first in 312). The system was not water efficient, and the volume of water that flowed was much more than necessary. 14 aqueducts were built, delivering 1 billion litres/day. It flowed continuously because they didn't have proper taps, no water storage, and aqueducts were not pressurised. Since water flowed in the streets, the sidewalks were high and raised pavement stones served as crosswalks.

The third concern was food. Daily food doles were distributed, pork and 1.4kg of bread. 

Infrastructures like the forum, Colosseum and city walls were built and expanded under different emperors. 

Housing was socially mixed, and to accommodate the population growth, buildings were built wit additional stories (from 3 stories in 3rd century BCE to 5 stories in 1st century BCE). These constructions became unstable due to the additional weight, even though they were built from solid brick.

Residential buildings had an enclosed patio. The ground floor had shops and storage rooms, and people lived above.

The city is noisy, dark at night, and polluted.

##### Pompeii
An unplanned old town, and a planned new city. They had the same raised sidewalks and crossing stones to avoid the flowing water, housing with atriums.

##### Novaesium, a Legion's Camp

Novaesium, or Neuss, is a city in North-Rhine-Westphalia near Düsseldorf, with many Roman sites.

The camps had exactly the same layout so that soldiers would always find their way around. There were regulations on where and how bathrooms, for eg., should be built.

They were built on elevated grounds to avoid flooding like in Rome. They were built along the Danube (from the Rhine, down to the Black sea) which created a boundary. 

Outside the camp, there were civilian settlements around, which ca be seen in Vienna's city centre.  

##### Ancient cities in contemporary knowledge
  
What is the point of this knowledge nowadays? Tourism and events, but also urban imaginaries. Knowledge is being recycled to create importance and awareness in the city.

### planning the medieval city

  

#### From the Roman Empire to the Middle Ages
The Dark Ages lasted between 500-1000 AD, and was a period of time between the Roman Empire and the Middle Ages. During the Dark Ages, much of the former powers disappeared (the Roman Empire disintegrated, which cut off trade routes and information flows except for the oriental merchants\alignedmarginparOrient = non-Latin speaking), technologies were lost, cities shrank and disappeared (eg. Trier, Cologne, Avenches). 

The "Ancient World" was fragmented into islands of small-scale, manorial feudalism, protected by fortifications and castles. $\rightarrow$ shrinkage, caused by ch

#### Early Middle Ages
...

#### High Middle Ages
Cities in the High Middle Ages have 6 origins:

1.  **Rebuilding on top of, and with, Roman remains**. They were former Roman cities, blossoming again as residences of Emperors (Aachen), Archbishops (Trier, Regensburg, Cologne) and Dukes (Vienna)

1.  **Monastery settlements** with Bishop's seat (Bamberg, Kaptol)

1.  **Castles of the Principality** (bourg) combined with settlement for craftsmen and merchants (faubourg, portus, Graz)

1.  **Commercial settlements** of free merchants and craftsmen, developed from wik settlements (merchant settlements), Germanic-Slavic origins

1.  Free manors and **Market-towns (Ackerbürgerstädte)

1.  Newly-founded **mining towns**, based on better knowledge of where coal, gold, may be found (Frankenberg, Sachsen, Freiberg (DE), Banska Stiavnica (Slovakia)...)

#### Characteristics of Medieval Cities

- City walls date from the Middle Ages, to protect against barbaric attacks, and a castle located higher on a hill
- Ditches around the city (graben)
- Narrow streets with burgher houses
- Church (goes without saying, a Christian endeavour)
- Central market square, need to feed the growing population

Almost all European cities date from the High Middle Ages, and European city tourism is exploiting these legacies.

##### High Medieval City

*ref. Vance chapter 4

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]leading_cities_1500

There is an upswing around 1200 AD (eg. Notre Dame 1163-1345). New Towns are founded and Ancient Towns are renewed. There is a strict separation of urban and rural functions\alignedmarginparref. Max Weber. There are two types of urban places:

-  Natural settlements: local market based central places, and
-  Systemic settlements: long distance trade based, with varying degree of freedom from Feudal powers

There are two hearths of Medieval urbanism, Flanders and North Italy (Po Basin and Tuscany). Flanders and North Italy are "trade-originating Europe'', with systematic settlements, and the rest is "trade-supporting Europe'' with natural settlements that depend on their role as central places.

Until today, both functions are important for a city to prosper: its role as a shopping and service centre for its region, and its "global city''-ness, based on its worldwide connectivity in services and goods.

There are two basic types of architecture:

-  Mediterranean: uninterrupted urban tradition
-  North of the Alps: new foundations and many new settlers

##### Mediterranean City

Unlike the ancient city, housing combines work and home due to a scarcity of space in the Medieval City. The houses are narrow burgher house-shops, or even house-towers built from local materials (stone, timber, adobe, studwork).

Conflicts between factions meant that structures like house-towers were built.

Remains of previous architecture can be traded as vernacular architecture (concerned with domestic and functional, and not public and monumental). Places like amphitheatres are recycled, along with their building materials.  

The Mediterranean city is a city of **factions** (house towers of Bologna, Lucca). It is a mix of Renaissance palaces, earliest tenement houses and individual houses, many arcades.

The Black Death pandemics (1348) more than halves the population of cities. 

##### North of the Alps

The city North of the Alps is a city of **guilds**. 

There are no City-States bordering each other, but (temporarily) Free Cities surrounded by feudal countryside. There is a stark contrast between urban and rural society.

There are two settlement systems, "central-place'' and "mercantile''. There's functional segregation based on guilds (unlike Mediterranean cities of `factions').

Merchants are clustering at "portus'' and then expanding.

The nobility still remains in their countryside castles (unlike Mediterranean cities where the nobility returned earlier). 

Tall house-shops, on narrow burgage plots, within tight city walls, catering for an extended family (including apprentices and journeymen).

"Quarters of Tolerance" for the outsiders like merchants, students...

#### Timeline of Medieval Cities

Similar to Ancient cities, from "geomorphic'' unplanned cities (type 1), evolving into more and more "geometric'' for newly-founded planned cities, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe.

1.  Unplanned cities (1100 AD)
2. Rebirth of the planned city
3. Zähringer's cross-shaped market towns
4. Towns with long market-streets
5. Towns with ladder-type streets
6. Rebirth of the grid city
7. The grid-shaped town (13th century)

### renaissance: planning the absolutist city

15th-16th century

#### ideal cities

Architectural proposals for ideal cities, safe, that were never built. 

For example, Leonardo suggested underground goods transport by boat (although waters were contaminated), and street level pedestrian streets.
Schonbrün looks south.

#### fortification towns

Fortress city
- defortification of old fortress city of Vienna (walls removed in 1857 after reluctant Emperor's approval) 

#### baroque

baroque, renaissance
- Praterstern, en étoile
- baroque zoo of Vienna

### early capitalism: industrial city miseries, early reforms

Previously, cities were not built for industries but for handicrafts (eg. vineyards in Vienna). 
An era with little urban planning.

#### manchester
*Hall chapter 10*
- Presents the industrial history but not so much urbanism
- ~1835: first and greatest industrial city of the world
- Raw materials: water, coal, iron, lime, salt, stone
- Possible reasons:
	- proto-industrialisation
	- networking
	- dissenting small entrepreneurs
	- combining textile and clockmaking traditions
	- polytechnic education- specialised schools
	- first innovative milieu
- Economic Freedom: granted since Weaver's act of 1558, attracting foreigners and Protestant refugees
- Putting-out system originally, drawn into vertical integration
- Innovations (1700s): flying shuttle, spinning by rollers, carding machine, jenny

*Friedrich Engels, 1820-1895*
- Originally pubilshed *Condition of the Working Class in England (1845)* originally in German and banned in English
- Observes deplorable living conditions in English cities: 
	- death from starvation
	- bad sanitary conditions (cholera pandemic)
	- slums: separate territories assigned to poverty, removed from the sight of happier classes
	- 50k homeless in London
	- dense and centralised population
- Strong element of Irish immigrants and of Irish extraction
- Outnumbering of workers to bourgeoisie 2:1, even 3-4:1 $\rightarrow$ how was such a society upheld if bourgeoisie was so outnumbered?
- Planning
	- Bad and irregular courts, lanes, back alleys. Manchester as a city **unprepared for new industry**
	- **Back to back housing**: new and efficient housing model (no through aeration), first urbanistic answer in industrial city
	- British Health Act (1848): first attempt at regulating the industriual city
		1.  Sewage and drainage
		2. Refuse removal
		3. Sanitary conditions
		4. Slaighterhouse regulations
		5. Ventilation and hygiene of tenement housing
		6. Street pavement and maintenance
		7. Public gardens and parks
		8. Water supply
		9. Funderal services
		10. Specific taxes and levies
		- $\rightarrow$ when was this introduced in a city of your choice??
- Prison reforms
- Poor Law Reforms
- Public Health Act
- Private philanthropist reforms: eg. privately built garden cities/settlements, Familistere, Port Sunlight


*$\Rightarrow$ Cities were not prepared for influx of people and industries $\rightarrow$ **no planning yet*** 

#### Glasgow
- A city on the European periphery, not even a sea-port
- 1765: James Watt invents the steam engine, upgrading earlier machinery; steam-driven, to be regulated; originally used for pumping water in mines, then in steam mills
- Glasgow benefits from emerging Trans-Atlantic economy
- Coal and iron deposits nearby, made accessible after 1801
- Steam boats first tried on inland waters, both in US and UK
- Firms have welfare programmes, ==including housing==
- 1888 and 1901: International exhibitions take place in Glasgow

#### tenement housing
- Paris
- New York: thin and high housing

### urban planning type I: urban engineering and fin de siècle urbanism
Urban planning type 1, the beginning of "planning as we know it"

The beginning of serious urban planning, focusing on massive infrastructure to make cities safe $\rightarrow$ **averting risks or adaptation planning**

#### urban planning types
Four phases on Planning Cultures
1. Adaptation planning (anpassungsplanung)
2. ??? (Auffangplanung)
3. Innovation planning (Entwicklungsplanung)
4. Perspective planning (Perspektivplanung)
5. New phase: sustainability planning

Administrative and engineering challenge arose when Vienna expanded in the 20th century. Only on top of a technical foundation was Red Vienna possible (eg. all the social housing, kindergartens...).

Vienna- stages of incorporation, 1850-1910
![[Vienna - stages of incorporation 1850-1910.png]]

**Building codes**
- Minimum width as to not be able to touch both sides of housing with armspan; medieval buildings can stay but new construction must follow width guidelines
- Grid pattern
	- Streets must be "as straight as possible"
	- Grid originated in New York City and became a planning norm
	- In Vienna, see the outer ring neighbourhoods
