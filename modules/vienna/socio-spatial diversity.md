### introduction

Fieldwork at AAKH  

#### Where do you see diversity?

Where do you see diversity? Where do you **not see diversity? When do socio-spatial effects emerge from "observed diversity''? Urban diversity in Vienna in comparison to what?

There is diversity in the **built environment** through buildings, public space; in **functions**, like residential, school, playground, transport; in **architecture**, through differences in height, density, older vs. modern architecture, balconies and winter gardens, the orientation of the roof (sloped or flat, new builds have flat roofs because they are more affordable to build, increase the potential rent of the top floor, and snow isn't a problem in Vienna anymore); in **living standards**, social and public vs. private housing; in **green infrastructure**, trees and grass.

What we do not see are a diversity of people, but could be due to the time of day and year; any **informal or illegal practices**, meaning anything against pre-defined functional uses, like sleeping rough, graffiti, dancing or performing which could feel unusual; **ethnic diversity**, there are no restaurants or shops representing minority populations and ethnic communities.

We are asking, **what is there, or isn't there, and why?**

What processes are causing the diversity, or lack thereof? **Exclusionary processes**, driven by neoliberal policies and the financialisation of the housing market; 

**lock-in effects** of the housing market, whereby older social housing buildings and apartments are much more affordable than newly built ones (est. up to twice as less), so even if by European standards rents are still affordable, moving into a newer and smaller (public) apartment can be very expensive. To get social housing, you must have lived in Vienna for some time, thus students and refugees are not eligible;

**migration** is a global driver of socio-demographic change (both domestic and international), caused by young people moving to the city, in Vienna, a low fertility rate means that migration is necessary to maintain/grow the population. Migration in Vienna is first and foremost domestic, joining the EU in 1995 opened migration to Germany, Eastern Europe, the Balkans, ex-Yugoslavian countries like Serbia Bosnia-Herzegovina, and circa 2015 Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq; 

**segregation**, which exists in a socially-mixed city like Vienna, even if the 'borders' are not so drastic.

#### Super-Diversity

*"'Super-diversity' is proposed as a summary term. Whatever we choose to call it, there is much to be gained by a multidimensional perspective on diversity, both in terms of moving beyond 'the ethnic group as either the unit of analysis or sole object of study' (Schiller et al., 2006) and by appreciating the coalescence of factors which condition people's lives''* (Steven Vertovec, 2007)

Ethnic communities are not homogeneous, and ethnicity as a category to speak about diversity is not enough. We require a multidimensional perspective.

*"The basic argument advanced for coining the term and developing the concept is that it describes changing patterns of global migration flows of the post-World War II decades that have entailed the movement of people from more varied national, ethnic linguistic, and religious backgrounds, who occupy more varied legal statuses, and who bring a wide range of human capital (education, work skills, and experience)''* (Foner et al., 2019)

#### Change, everyday life, socio-spatial disparities

**Change** what dimensions does "demographic change'' include in the context of super-diversity?
**Everyday life** how are practices of living together formed in urban neighbourhoods?
**Socio-spatial diversity** how do consequences and outcomes manifest in everyday?

Brainstorming **research questions** based on the reading - use why, what (analytical), how (descriptive)...

- Can socio-spatial disparities ever have a positive impact on minority groups? $\rightarrow$ socio-spatial disparities
- When comparing refugees from the Ukrainian war in 2022 and refugees from the Middle-East in 2015 (themselves a highly diverse, non homogenous group), how do public policies and public discourse influence these people's experience and integration into Vienna

### housing Market
Guest lecturer Celine Janssen

#### Housing in Vienna

A **housing segment** is a category below housing, which explains the variety of housing types. 

**Red Vienna** refers to the social policies and the start of communal housing, in the 1920s, when the Social Democrats were in power. This period between the two world wars was particular: Vienna became a province (not only a city) and gained more rights, and could purchase land at an affordable price due to the bad economic situation, which was used for social builds. 

Is 'Red Vienna' possible today? No, because in the 1920s the political situation and the land prices were very different to today.

The public (council) housing, or Gemeindebau, are large and imposing buildings. There was a political idea to educate the lower classes, also with culture, and every Gemeindebau must have visible artwork on the outer walls.

#### Gemeindebau

- Red Vienna Waschsalon
- Gemeindebau in 5th district, on the belt/Gurkel. The idea at the beginning was to provide artists with affordable spaces to do their work, and still today serve this purpose.

Vienna became the city of affordable housing. This changed with the global financial crisis, after which real estate investment became attractive and subsidised housing was less considered.

#### Subsidised rental housing

There is non-for-profit housing in Vienna, subsidised rental housing which is accessible to those who cannot access council housing. It has public and available open space. 

There are opportunities for public/private partnerships, where private for-profit developers can build housing but must provide affordable rents (cost rent/kostenmiete).

Subsidised rental housing is where new households can move in and find affordable rents, but in the trajectory of social housing, it is the answer to the Gemeindebau whose model would not be efficient today\alignedmarginparWhy?.

#### Private rental market

The private rental market is an important sector in Vienna and represents 30\% of the housing. The city has the least influence, or power, in this sector.

The private market is any building built before 1945 (end of WWII) and not owned by the city. Still, the rents are regulated. Rent regulation is a federal law (a national law applying to every Austrian city) and applies to all the private rental houses. The city doesn't have power to change the rent regulation.

New private builds do not fall under rent regulation, and any new builds on top of pre-1945 private housing is also not regulated.

The green party and conservatives who are in power in Austria, find support in private ownership and thus their ideology is not to provide affordable rents. This instead is the ideology of the social democrats. At the city level, with the green and conservative party, you cannot change the rent regulation because you need a majority at the national level. 

To address the private rental market, the city came up with **soft urban renewal programmes**. It was during a period of time when the city was shrinking, and some old housing stock was decaying and the city was losing buildings due to the lack of financial capacity to renovate. The soft urban renewal programme was the answer, but is often the starting point of the gentrification debate in Vienna.

The private market is highly financialised, they are fully furnished apartments where people/owners do not live full-time but only part of the year, eg. high income expats or investors. This market is unregulated, the price isn't capped and can be sold or rented to the highest bidder.

#### Vienna's housing market

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]Vienna_housing_segments

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]Vienna_housing_market  

#### Diversity

How is the housing market related to urban diversity?

Vienna ranks high in the liveable city rankings because of the affordable housing - but the target audience of the rankings, ie. high income expats, will not be the ones to benefit from the affordable or public housing.

#### Social mix in a social welfare state

1230, Vienna: Alterlaa by Harry Glück, in Liesing. Built an alternative mode of living, with high rise buildings but that contain the elements that is important for our standards of living: balconies, private (outdoor) spaces, a swimming pool on the roof, surrounded by open space,  social infrastructure, commercial space (shopping mall) but now more a medical centre, to cater to the aging population in the building.

Social mix, in the UK, was used as an explanation why renovation is taking place, and the effect of renovation is the upgrading of the residential composition. Can this be referred to as State-led gentrification? It created direct displacement, and a buy-out of the apartments.

In the US, property taxes are linked to the value of the property, and a huge interest of the public actor for high property values to get high tax returns. Thus, having a high-income household with low property value results in low tax returns for the city. Social mix is a fiscal policy used to de-concentrate poverty.

The idea is that middle-class households create trickle down effects in their community and are role-models in the lower income households and should participate in social mobility. However, this is incredibly difficult to prove empirically and there is a debate as to whether this is a myth to legitimise gentrification practices.

#### From social mix to social mixing

Social mixing is an effect of daily practices. 

Middle-class households are attracted by ethnically diverse neighbourhoods, but there is no social interactions on a daily basis, and the 'social tectonics' are parallel but do not overlap (Jackson and Butler, 2014).

In urban planning, the concept of social mix is used as a political smokescreen without distinct definitions and measures. 

#### Planning for social mix 

Seestadt Aspen seems to be ideally planned for social mix.

Who? Actors: public, institutional/individual private, intermediaries. Scales: macro (EU), national, province, city, district neighbourhood.

How? Resources: financial means, time, 'power'. Institutional boundaries: laws and regulations.

Why? Rationalities, bounded rationality

#### Who makes the city?
Celine Jansenn

Urban development management focuses on the issues of urban and regional development and institutional design. 

Area development, or regeneration, urban transformation, urban redevelopment projects, are area-based development projects. It focuses on understanding the role of area-based development projects in solving urban problems. 

To research area development, you can take multiple perspectives: spatial, economic, management/corporate, public administration, governance, institutional, etc.

In area development, there are many ideals, but how do you decide what should be developed? There are societal challenges such as CO2 reduction, energy transition, climate adaptation, biodiversity, more affordable housing, alternative mobility, social inclusion, etc. So how do we decide how the land should be used? The design of multifunctional spaces, a political choice.

...

How do you recognise social sustainability in the built environment? There are tangible and intangible ways. Tangible: decent housing, transport, daily facilities, recreation, jobs, schools, public spaces, healthcare, urban design. Intangible: social interaction, social networks, cultural expression, feeling of belonging, feeling of community, safety, wellbeing, existence of informal groups and associations, representation by local governments.

### gentrification
*Fieldwork at MuseumQuartier $\rightarrow$ Westbahnhof

What are the different [[gentrification]] processes that take place in parallel, and which processes are/aren't visible? There are various interrelated processes, that contribute to high-complexity.

#### Gentrification (every-) where? how?

Gentrification started in big cities like London and New York, spreading to cities like Vienna, and eastern Europe. 

Not all change is visible in the built environment, gentrification is a process that goes beyond urban regeneration. But, this might be a first indicator visible in the city. Brownfield conversions might not be displacing people since no one was living there, but it will have an impact on the surrounding environment. 

Thus, the built environment is a good starting point, but the most influential/interesting processes are not this visible. For example, changes on the financial market (money), demographic changes, or changes in lifestyle preferences can lead to gentrification.

**Glocalisation** shows that the local outcomes are related to global processes.

#### Defining Gentrification

A continuous and embedded process. You can take a relational approach to define how the 'gentrifying' population is. \urlbeyondgentrification.com. Upgrading (vs. shrinking) processes are continuous, and happen quickly.

Ruth Glass observed a process in Islington, where old brick housings were renovated, and the blue collar class were pushed out. 

It is a process of the private housing sector, not the social housing sector.

#### Characteristics of Gentrification

Linked to urban renewal and urban regeneration processes, and cannot be found in a shrinking context (when population is declining in cities, gentrification is not taking place). The driving forces are eg. urban renaissance, reurbanisation processes.

The role of time \& space, there is **socio-spatial change** (when did gentrification start?), and **temporal dynamics** (why is gentrification happening faster in ... compared to ...?)

Has an inherent element of **displacement. **Direct displacement** in the strict sense, and **exclusionary displacement** in the wider sense where people are made to feel un-welcomed, the sense of belonging is removed, and people get the feeling that life is becoming unaffordable in their neighbourhood. There is a psychological element where people fear higher rents (eg. when the rent freeze period expires).

#### Various forms of gentrification

Consumption based (bottom-up), about changing lifestyle, commercial gentrification, the cost of gentrification (what is being lost?). Tends to take longer.

Production based (top-down) led by shops like Starbucks or American Apparel, who pretend to be sustainable but gentrify neighbourhoods and the high streets.

Students participate in gentrification, and happens strongly in cities where there are 'campus universities', where students live and study on campus (eg. NYU is a major developer in NY). Students once wanted print shops, but now need eg. Apple stores; they have a privileged position in the city. There is a financialisation of the student housing. 

**Super-gentrification** is led by the FIRE sector (finance, insurance, real estate), and by those who are employed in it. But also lifestyles of the high income populations, eg. 'dinkies' (double income no kids).

%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]gentrification_forms

Social exclusion risks based on various forms of gentrification:

Super-gentrification $\rightarrow$ eg. labour market transitions

New-built gentrification $\rightarrow$ eg. large-scale new residential areas

Studentification $\rightarrow$ eg. change of socio-demographic makeup

Tourism gentrification $\rightarrow$ eg. change of uses in the public space (hotels, boutique/luxury hotels as gentrifiers, shops and services catering to tourists)

Commercial gentrification $\rightarrow$ eg. change of commercial landscape

Green gentrification $\rightarrow$ eg. change of public space provision

#### Public subsidies for renovation

The public sector invented the soft urban renewal program ("Sanfte Stadterneuerung''), in order to incentivised the private sector to invest in deteriorating buildings.

It is headed by wohnfonds Vienna and is for (block) renovation and thermic rejuvenation. 

The aim is for existing tenants to remain in their neighbourhood after the renovation, and can be compensated for inconveniences caused by renovations. There are subsidies in terms of loan at low-interest rates (1\% interest rate from public sector compared to 15\% from banks in the 1980s-90s), for full renovation. But nowadays, the public interest-rates are not interesting anymore because the bank interest rates are low and comparable, without the same inconveniences and regulations that come with the soft urban renewal program.

The public sector, by giving the money, has the power to set the rules - this power is lost when loans come from the banks/private sector. The government created a regulation mechanism where there were no rent increases, ...

#### Preventing gentrification

Many policies in place. 

Gentrification is a phenomenon of financialisation, which makes it more than an urban research concept - it is a political topic, about **housing as a basic need**. Gentrification is rooted in the core of politics - who is elected to represent the residents, and does this representation ensure that housing as a basic need is fulfilled? Or, is gentrification a phenomenon we accept as **a necessary consequence of capitalism?** 

It becomes about activism and knowledge transfer, so that renters know and understand their rights and get a fair price for their housing. Also turns to alternative forms of housing, like housing co-creation in community led housing (eg. self-building groups, community land trust).

### arrival space & the tole of public space

Arrival spaces vs. arrival cities 
- Nashville, Tenessee: the city has the largest Kurdish population in the US, because kurds choose to move there from their government-assigned city to reunite with family and friends
- Calais: space of arrival (and departure) for the channel crossing
- Maximilianpark, Brussels
- Transient spaces: cities close to (eg. Polish) borders which are first points of arrival but where people stay as short as possible


#### arrival cities

"Arrival City", Doug Sanders
- Criticised as being over optimistic about migration- says that every city is an arrival city and people can make the opportunities for themselves (individuals have the responsibility to climb the social ladder) BUT it is not easy to create a life/make a living in the short term; businesses and services from migrants take a long time to be created

#### starting the arrival
- . NGOs have the energy and resources to act fast and support new comers spontaneously; in Vienna during the immigration period in 2015, NGOs (eg. Train of Hope) explained the situation and options to migrants wanting to reach Germany and being wary of arriving in Austria
- Immigration experiences
	- Humanitarian racism: treating immigrants differently based on an implicient hierarchy; eg. making resources and entry accessible to Ukrainian refugees, but not for Syrian/Afghan refugees (double standards)

#### framing arrival

- **Arrival infrastructure**- what?
	- socio-material infrastructure, migration infrastructure, micro-publics/common spaces, peripheral estates, housing market
- **Arrival mechanisms**- how?
	- arrival-specific knowledge, housing policy, (everyday) encounters, temporariness
	- who has access to social housing, and who doesn't?
	- 
- **Arrival effects**- where to?
	- housing market integration, policies of dispersion vs. arrival neighbourhoods, hospitality, humanitarianism, post migration
	- policies influence segregation (concentration vs. dispersion, no arrival neighbourhoods because they would be 'dangerous'...); hostility vs. solidary cities; 

- Projects working outside the (problematic) categories of immigration
	- Magdas Hotel- near Prater, former elderly care home run by Caritas, transformed into a hotel run by refugees/asylum seekers training in the hotel industry
	- Stand129 market place- former market stall where you can 'buy knowledge', language/dancing/cooking classes, related to informal setting, open to the neighbourhood and ran by refugees
	- Is labour market integration "arrival", or is it later?

#### arrival challenges

Challenges from **arrival concepts**
- *Character*: fluidity, openness, temporality
	- Challenge: fuzziness of concept
- *Methodology*: no established empirical experience
	- Challenge: case by case analyses; contextuality; comparability
- *Theory-building*
	- Challenge

Challenges from **arrival practices**
- *Character*: Self ascribed openness, temporality; 
	- Challenge: (non-) institutionalisation
	- "Everyone is welcome"? Trandisciplinary projects have the power to challenge whether projects are as open as self-described
- *Methodology*: arrival practice vs. practice to enable arrival?
	- Challenge: reflexivity, structural dependency
	- Learning and transferability is content-dependent
- *Theory-building*: participation in (research) prokect during a limited "moment in time" (==temporality==) 
	- Challenge: representativity; path dependencies; sustainability of practices (in terms of time and funding)
	- As researchers, it is our task to support civic associations/NGOs and speak about them; 

#### challenging the notion of arrival - or challenged by arrival?

1. From theoretical concept to local practice, or vice versa
	- Relational approaches needed

2. Complementary instread of redundant empirical knowledge
	- Deconstruction of migration complexities (ref. superdiversity)

3. From single-case knowledge to "heuristic of arrival"
	- Universal applicability vs. contextual embeddedness
	- Transferability to planning and policy making

4. Fostering transdisciplinary (knowledge) co-creation
