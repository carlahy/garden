### research design
![[research design.png]]
- what is unit of analysis? eg. policy, community, space...

#### research design
what is the overall strategy you will use to answer the rq?

#### researcher paradigms

*Researcher paradigm*: what is the nature of social reality, how should it be studied
*Research nature*: what kind of aim does the research have, exploratory/descriptive/explanatory
*Research reasoning*: what kind of logic does the research employ, deductive/inductive/abductive
*Research type*: what kind of methods will be used, quantitative/qualitative/mixed-methods

ontology, epistemology: 1 (positivist - ) 2 (critical realist) 3 (interpretivist) 
methodology: 4 (pragmatic)
axiology: 5 (critical)
- **Ontology**: dealing with the nature of reality
	1. Fixed and universal; context and perception independent
	2. Fixed and constructed
	3. Multiple and socially constructed (group perception)
	4. Multiple and individually constructed (individual perception)
	5. Historically embedded in power structures
- **Epistemology**: dealing with the nature of knowledge
	1. What is verifiable with empirical data
	2. We can only know observable, not the "real"
	3. The ways we socially construct it
	4. Individual interpretations
	5. 
- **Methodology**: dealing with ways of gaining knowledge
	1. Experiments and quantifiable measurements
	2. Depends on questions being asked
	3. Interaction and immersion (be part of it)
	4. Mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative together)
	5. Through dialogue with participants and engagement with power structures
- **Axiology**: dealing with values (what matters, is important)
	1. Beneficence, goodness
	2. Caution and pluralism (aknowledging different views)
	3. Those of the researcher, balanced by a fair assessment od data
	4. Desire to "improve" human behaviour
	5. Concern with inequality and respect for cultural norms

#### research paradigm

- **Deductive**: theory $\rightarrow$ hypothesis $\rightarrow$ data $\rightarrow$ confirmation?
- **Inductive**: data $\rightarrow$ pattern $\rightarrow$ tentative hypothesis $\rightarrow$ theory?
	- data is leading everything
- **Abductive**: incomplete observations $\leftarrow$ hypotheses $\rightarrow$ theory elaboration

#### problem statement & RQ

Blue spaces contribute to making a city's residents healthier and happier, and thus everyone should benefit from equal access to waterfronts.
However, some have greater access to blue spaces while others suffer injustices on the grounds of social factors like income or immigration background.
Unequal access to blue spaces reinforces inequialities in the city, and disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations.

My research will address this problem by examining people's perceptions and experiences of the blue spaces they interact (or not) with, to understand *who* is most welcomed in the space and *why*.
In particular, I aim to answer the following question: **what physical and experential qualities of a blue space provide (unfair) access to the space, and for whom**, ultimately influencing environmental justice in the city?

### guiding frameworks
*the theories and concepts shaping your research approach*
#### research paradigm, nature, reasoning, type

My research is concerned with urban enviromental justice, which says that access to the benefits of nature should be equitably shared in a city. 

The social reality is that some people have greater access to nature than others, for numerous reasons. For example, the distance of their home to the water, what is allowed or not to do at the waterfront, or the feelings of safety in the space. I am concerned specifically about the perceptions and values that people hold, which determine if and how they interact with blue spaces near them. 
The nature of this reality is historically embedded in power structures which give the most priviledged residents better access to nature. This results in spaces that are not accessible, inclusive, safe or diverse.
Understanding this reality requires understanding the subjective experiences of the people living in this reality.
Ultimately, my research is driven by a concern for inequality and urban environmental justice.

Given the above, my research will be explanatory and will take an inductive approach. My aim is to explain why some people have greater access to blue space, who these people are, and conclude what qualities of the space or what social phenomenon prevents some people from access waterfronts.

This question is broken down into three sub goals:
1. What is the socio-demographic profile of the neighbourhood (where the blue space is located)?
2. Who are the users of the space, and what is their experience of this space?
3. Who is not present in the space, and, based on the users' experience, what are the factors of exclusion?

These will help understand --> todo

Research reasoning: what kind of logic does the research employ, deductive/inductive/abductive
The reasoning of the research will be inductive - collecting data from the field will enable me to find patterns, create tentitative hypotheses, and finally develop a theory.


Research type: what kind of methods will be used, quantitative/qualitative/mixed-methods
To address the research question, I will use qualitative methods in order to understand subjective experiences, perceptions and values of users. 


#### theoretical/conceptual framework
*the theories and concepts shaping your research approach*

Theoretical framework: the theories you will draw from and how they help explain the things you plan to study and the relationships that connect them

The theoretical frameworks which will guide my research are urban environmental justice


### methodology
*the logic guiding your choice of methods*
#### methodologY

methodology: the rationale behind the selection of methods

The qualititative methodology I will employ in my research is a case study. This will allow me to explore in-depth a blue space and people's experience and perceptions of this space... 


### data collection and analytic methods
*the focus and boundaries of your research*

#### methods of data collection & analysis
Map-based survey: distribute the survey within the neighbourhood of interest, door-to-door; may get access to non-users
I could copy the PPGIS method from [[@raymond2016integrating]] and analyse PPUE and diversity of uses/users.

Interview: interviews in person with users of the blue space; wouldn't get access to users

### object of research/cases
*how you will collect data, how you will analyse the data you collect*
#### Unit of analysis and Case

Unit of analysis: individuals within one neighbourhood, chosen near a blue space of interest

The unit of analysis I will focus on are the users of the waterfront XX in Copenhagen, and those living in the surrounding neighbourhood XX.

The type of blue space of interest for my research are inland, natural spaces (eg. rivers, lakes, harbours, ) which support a multitude of uses (eg. swimming, sitting, walking, playing, exercise...) and are seemingly accessible for a maximum of users (eg. accessible on foot/bike/public transport in a decent amount of time, wheelchair/stroller/limited mobility accessible terrain, well-lit space, clean) to limit the "obvious" reasons individuals may not want to access the space. 

I will collect interviews from the users directly at the waterfront, and also 


- If feasible/time allows, might interview people who live far from a blue space.
But then, do I focus on a blue space specifically or a neighbourhood specifically? Because if I focus on one blue space, and talk to a "far" neighbourhood, they might not relate specifically to that blue space. 

### timeline and workplan
*when and how you plan to accomplish each task*
