## notes


### research design
- what is unit of analysis? eg. policy, community, space...

#### research design
what is the overall strategy you will use to answer the rq?

#### researcher paradigms
ontology, epistemology: 1 (positivist - ) 2 (critical realist) 3 (interpretivist) 
methodology: 4 (pragmatic)
axiology: 5 (critical)
- **Ontology**: dealing with the nature of reality
	1. Fixed and universal; context and perception independent
	2. Fixed and constructed
	3. Multiple and socially constructed (group perception)
	4. Multiple and individually constructed (individual perception)
	5. Historically embedded in power structures
- **Epistemology**: dealing with the nature of knowledge
	1. What is verifiable with empirical data
	2. We can only know observable, not the "real"
	3. The ways we socially construct it
	4. Individual interpretations
	5. 
- **Methodology**: dealing with ways of gaining knowledge
	1. Experiments and quantifiable measurements
	2. Depends on questions being asked
	3. Interaction and immersion (be part of it)
	4. Mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative together)
	5. Through dialogue with participants and engagement with power structures
- **Axiology**: dealing with values (what matters, is important)
	1. Beneficence, goodness
	2. Caution and pluralism (aknowledging different views)
	3. Those of the researcher, balanced by a fair assessment od data
	4. Desire to "improve" human behaviour
	5. Concern with inequality and respect for cultural norms

#### research paradigm

- **Deductive**: theory $\rightarrow$ hypothesis $\rightarrow$ data $\rightarrow$ confirmation?
- **Inductive**: data $\rightarrow$ pattern $\rightarrow$ tentative hypothesis $\rightarrow$ theory?
	- data is leading everything
- **Abductive**: incomplete observations $\leftarrow$ hypotheses $\rightarrow$ theory elaboration
