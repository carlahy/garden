*Typology*:
- *Input*: resources required for implementation, including quantity, quality and timeliness
- *Process*: measure whether planned activities took place (eg. meetings, training courses, distribution of smart meters)
- *Output*: details in relation to the product/output of activity (eg. number of smart meters distributed, number of electric buses)
- *Outcome*: measuring the results of the output with regards to the main objective (eg. outcome of thermal isolation program could be number of well isolated dwellings as % of total number of dwellings covered by the program)
- *Impact*: measuring the quality and quantity of long-term results generated by program outputs (eg. change in quality of life, reduced energy use, reduced air pollution)
