### Transdisciplinarity

#transformative and #transdisciplinary knowledge

Forms of knowledge
- System knowledge: objective understandings of systemic interrelationships
- Target knowledge: about desirable and normative futures
- Transformation knowledge: context and actor specific, about the possibilities of shaping transformation processes that have an impoact on sustainability, developed and pplied by means of experimental processes

Importance of **participation**

##### Designing the research

Methods: [scnat knowledge and td net toolbox](https://naturalsciences.ch/co-producing-knowledge-explained/)

Roles of researchers:
- Reflexive
- ...

**Rich picture method**: used in the beginning of transdisciplinary research process, to visualise implicit and explicit knowledge of participants, grasp complexity, relation aspects, decide focus area for intervention, combining thought styles

##### Urban Living Labs

#urban-living-labs

Objectives: following a normative orientation

Phases:
1. **Co-design**: addressing/defining real-world problems and normative frameworks; develop systems knowledge
2. **Co-production**: translating intervention ideas into concrete, solution oriented experiments; reflection on interventions
3. **Co-evaluation**: 

#### Circularity in the built-environment

Fields of action:
- Not focusing on the new-builds only
- Utilisation of buildings in different times of day/week
- Reusing grey water
- Closed material cycles
- Less materials, more robust constructions/durability
- Renewable, recyclable, health resources for building materials and components
- Social justice
- Diversity in social, conceptual and cultural, biodiversity


What is the problem, from point of view of practitioners, why the city isn't circular -> define the problem
Try to find out from experts what they perceive the problems/key challenges are

Experts:
* Andreas Hoffer - architect, urban design at TUWien, founded 'retrofitvienna', working with applied research, working on public housing/[[Gemeindebauten]] (post-war 50s-70s);
* Peter Kleidinger - material nomaden, private company since 2015 working with reused materials they get from buildings and design products from these reuse materials; design process from sourcing to industry, and back (closing loop)
* Thomas Romm - environmental architect, BauKarussell

##### Circularity and fields of action for urban environment in Vienna
Only 12% of waste is reused in Austria, can we do 100%? No, but what can we do about it? Waste mostly made up of construction waste (demolition and excavation waste)

Options are:
1. Close the loops
2. Less is more: what can we do with our existing structures
3. Renewable resources: how to make concrete and brick renewable?

Use case - Wiener Wohnbaumprogramm
- Wiener Wohnbaumprogramm: bringing timber into large scale housing developments, for subsidised housing
- Pillars
	- Building longitivity
	- Performance of building
	- Social sustainability
- Social urban mining
	- Collection of materials (eg. copper)
	- Finance work with values in the building
	- Only social and local enterprises

Use case - Eco-Urbanism
- Resilient urban design, urban ecology, circular construction, soil preservation (so it doesn't go to landfill), material extraction (for onsite construction)
- Enlarging landscapes by bringing in a hill and increasing surface area
- -> landscape design is at the same importance as architecture
- How to cope with winds, and cooling winds in the summer? -> micro-climate analysis

### Methods Training
#methods

#### Reflection on three methods

*Visual methods and ethnographic research* (UCL)
- Using images to reflect on the development of the city: who/what is represented in these images? Why these images? -> power, power relations
- Triangulation: bringing together methods/data, relating them
- Working with a community, co-creation/co-production, empowering people to know their ordinary life, gain awareness of metaphores arising from daily life

*[[PPGIS]]* (Aalto University)
- What is GIS, and how is spatial data analysed? Typically, GIS analyses data on the physical environment
- PPGIS integrates human knowledge about space: how is it used, perceived, experienced
- Willingness of people to engage with the method, clear communication

*Quantitative Methods* (BCNUEJ)
- Analysing data on superblocks (as single units, and a collection of units) around health care, eg. pollution
- What indicators are used to measure health? Who decides these? Why? How are they collected and analysed? -> trace data back to source to understand the decisions behind the data
- Difference in desgin for quantitative vs. qualitative research, and using them to complement each other
-
