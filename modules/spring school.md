### Transdisciplinarity

#transformative and #transdisciplinary knowledge

Forms of knowledge
- System knowledge: objective understandings of systemic interrelationships
- Target knowledge: about desirable and normative futures
- Transformation knowledge: context and actor specific, about the possibilities of shaping transformation processes that have an impoact on sustainability, developed and pplied by means of experimental processes

Importance of **participation**

#### Designing the research

Methods: [scnat knowledge and td net toolbox](https://naturalsciences.ch/co-producing-knowledge-explained/)

Roles of researchers:
- Reflexive
- ...

**Rich picture method**: used in the beginning of transdisciplinary research process, to visualise implicit and explicit knowledge of participants, grasp complexity, relation aspects, decide focus area for intervention, combining thought styles

#### Urban Living Labs

#urban-living-labs

Objectives: following a normative orientation

Phases:
1. **Co-design**: addressing/defining real-world problems and normative frameworks; develop systems knowledge
2. **Co-production**: translating intervention ideas into concrete, solution oriented experiments; reflection on interventions
3. **Co-evaluation**: 

### Circularity in the built-environment

Fields of action:
- Not focusing on the new-builds only
- Utilisation of buildings in different times of day/week
- Reusing grey water
- Closed material cycles
- Less materials, more robust constructions/durability
- Renewable, recyclable, health resources for building materials and components
- Social justice
- Diversity in social, conceptual and cultural, biodiversity


What is the problem, from point of view of practitioners, why the city isn't circular -> define the problem
Try to find out from experts what they perceive the problems/key challenges are

Experts:
* Andreas Hoffer - architect, urban design at TUWien, founded 'retrofitvienna', working with applied research, working on public housing/[[Gemeindebauten]] (post-war 50s-70s);
* Peter Kleidinger - material nomaden, private company since 2015 working with reused materials they get from buildings and design products from these reuse materials; design process from sourcing to industry, and back (closing loop)
* Thomas Romm - environmental architect, BauKarussell

#### Circularity and fields of action for urban environment in Vienna
Only 12% of waste is reused in Austria, can we do 100%? No, but what can we do about it? Waste mostly made up of construction waste (demolition and excavation waste)

Options are:
1. Close the loops
2. Less is more: what can we do with our existing structures
3. Renewable resources: how to make concrete and brick renewable?

Use case - Wiener Wohnbaumprogramm
- Wiener Wohnbaumprogramm: bringing timber into large scale housing developments, for subsidised housing
- Pillars
	- Building longitivity
	- Performance of building
	- Social sustainability
- Social urban mining
	- Collection of materials (eg. copper)
	- Finance work with values in the building
	- Only social and local enterprises

Use case - Eco-Urbanism
- Resilient urban design, urban ecology, circular construction, soil preservation (so it doesn't go to landfill), material extraction (for onsite construction)
- Enlarging landscapes by bringing in a hill and increasing surface area
- -> landscape design is at the same importance as architecture
- How to cope with winds, and cooling winds in the summer? -> micro-climate analysis

### Methods Training
#methods

#### Reflection on three methods

*Visual methods and ethnographic research* (UCL)
- Using images to reflect on the development of the city: who/what is represented in these images? Why these images? -> power, power relations
- Triangulation: bringing together methods/data, relating them
- Working with a community, co-creation/co-production, empowering people to know their ordinary life, gain awareness of metaphores arising from daily life
- Observations and photography

*[[PPGIS]]* (Aalto University)
- What is GIS, and how is spatial data analysed? Typically, GIS analyses data on the physical environment
- PPGIS integrates human knowledge about space: how is it used, perceived, experienced
- Willingness of people to engage with the method, clear communication

*Quantitative Methods* (BCNUEJ)
- Analysing data on superblocks (as single units, and a collection of units) around health care, eg. pollution
- What indicators are used to measure health? Who decides these? Why? How are they collected and analysed? -> trace data back to source to understand the decisions behind the data
- Difference in desgin for quantitative vs. qualitative research, and using them to complement each other

### Urban Futures Studio
#futuring #imaginaries

*Utrecht University, Maarten Hajer*
[Urban futures studio](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/urban-futures-studio)
[Transdisciplinary field guide](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/transdisciplinary-field-guide)

- An experimental unit
- Moving beyond from extractive research (eg. data extraction from surveys), but rather make it cyclical
- Using alternative techniques
- TINA (there is no alternative) - false!
	- Visualising different urban futures through different coloured lenses

>If you would work at the Urban Futures Studio, how would you programme its activities?
- Thinking about creating *many* futures, creating a tree-like structure, starting from one alternative, which branches out into many alternatives
- A collaborative exercise
- Integration indigeneous knowledge
- Inviting scientists to witness the discussions and 'soft' methods

#### Studying social change
- Comprehending social change and how it works is challenging
- How can we study what has not yet happened?
- **Futuring**: attempts at shaping the space for action by identifying and circulating images of the future, a process by which relationship between past, present and future are enacted
	- Futuring for sustainability: trying to get a handle on urban politics by looking how the 'future' features in the search for sustainable cities
	- Cultural pathways: finding culture shifts of doing, being
- **Imaginaries**: collectively held and performed visions of desirable futures

#### Futuring
- 1939 Futurama world expo: pavilions by countries and by large industries (eg. General Motors), following the trend of commercial, capitalist United States; pavilions based on escaping the city by living in the suburbs (alternatives, allow people to imagine what could be their lives) -> futuring 'par excellence', a racial concept (escaping communities living in the inner city)
	- Advertising a desirable/enviable future
	- Governments and industries *made* the future as imagined, inevitable

How to know the future?
- Will look like: prediction
- Might look like: projection and scenarios
- Could look like: opening up
- Should look like: normative interventions

What we think is possible, or impossible, isn't the only alternative. We are constrained about what is difficult to imagined, and what is *unthinkable*.

#### COnclusions
- Tend to see the future according to own, recent, contextualised understandings of the present
- Futuring: happens everywhere; social practice that combines forms of knowledge; *unequal*, different types of futuring have different effects on what types of futures we can imagine and plan for, and who is included; => need to help define how we can bring urban futures that are ecologically sounds and socially just


#### Post fossil city
- imagining the post-fossil city as a green and just city
- need to rethink: energy sources, mobility, shelter, food -> the entire urban existence 
- #book *Neighbourhoods for the Future - A Plea for Social and Ecological Urbanism*
	- Re-imagining cities from the neighbourhood up
	- Examples of the post-fossil city, how it works, and why it works

#### Neighbourhoods 
-  Small enough to be tangible, big enough to make a difference
- Thriving neigbhourhoods create thriving cities (collection of units making the whole)
- Neighbourhood ecology: the component parts (services, nodes for exchange, mateiral infrastructures) that, in their interaction make a neighbourhood into a 'good' neigbhourhood
- Neighbourhood arrangement:
	- Discourse: ensembles of ideas, concepts, categories through which meaning is given; shared language and storylines
	- Actors: sense of ownership, long-term interest; knowing the neighbourhood
	- Resources: financial sustainability; *neigbhourhood value chain* => keeping value in the neighbourhood
	- Rules: urban code; simplicity and stability -> not being too directive, which erodes creativity


> What could you, as a planner, do to create a neigbhbourhood value chain?
- Legal provision; ownernship structures; development rights; selection procedures; financial instruments; partipatory logics; oversight mechanisms

- Retain financial and social value of neighbourhood, while avoiding privatisation of public-domain over the neighbourhoods

Brainstorming: Community Neighbourhood Trust
- legal provision
- ownernship structures: land owned by the trust, housing owned by residents
- development rights: rights given by the board
- selection procedures: for residents and businesses
- financial instruments: businesses pay rent and 'solidarity fund' (tax), used for developments; resident rent (but low)
- partipatory logics: board; resident approval for new projects; reception centre (community centre)
- oversight mechanisms: multitude of commitees (culture, education)
- there's a board:
	- decides if a business is needed or valuable for the neighbourhood, or if it introduces too much competition

Discussions
- Housing
	- Non-for-profit housing cooperatives and developers
	- Active participation, shared ownership of residents into the model
	- Community Land Trusts
- Money
	- Participatory budgeting, deciding on businesses
	- Social capital: integenerational wealth creation, community capital and real estate
	- Local currencies
- Communities
	- Not always bounded within the neighbourhood, are we idealising the neighbourhood life?
- Participation
	- Active citizenship
