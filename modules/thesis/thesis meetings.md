## Meeting notes

### April 27th
- Decided to focus on people's experiences of a blue space
	- ref. diagram
- Theoretical framework - environmental justice
	- What dimension specifically? Liked critical approach of the traditional dimensions in [[@anguelovski2020expanding]], but what *specifically*?
	- Do I systematically have to analyse injustices? (eg. green gentrification/displacement, green exclusion... ref. [[@anguelovski2020expanding]])
	- ~~What is my approach to EJ? Should I find a set of dimensions (eg. diversity of users, and diversity of uses) and analyse them? Should I look for signs of injustice, as a way to prove or disprove that a space contributes to justince/injustice?

- Methods
	- PPGIS: qualitative data combined with spatial data, can analyse people's experiences, perceptions, uses of a space, and ask about their identities
	- OR mental mapping? allows people to express themselves without predefined categories/labels/interpretations
	- ALSO like idea of futuring, where people are free to invent alternative futures/new imaginaries of a space
	- BUT how to get access to the right individuals/communities? how to access the invisible? how much data is "too little data"? ethics?
	- Observational methods? but positionality, bias...
- Case study/comparative study:
	- I like the idea of comparisons, because it makes it easier (for me at least) to judge
	- I think a comparative study of cases in 2 different countries, where I have to collect data myself, will be a lot of work/hard because the collection will happen in 2 different semesters, one in the semester i have to finish the thesis
	- Maybe comparing two blue spaces in one city (Copenhagen?), and in two neighbourhoods with *distinct socio-economic demographics*?
	- Wdyt about Copenhagen as a case city? Don't want to research a place that's already been studied, but also practical to use it because 1. i will be there, 2. there are a lot of blue spaces, 3. northern europe known for its social welfare/equality, but its changing

- Main questions/general comments:

	- Liked the critical approach to EJ presented in [[@anguelovski2020expanding]]
	- What analytical/theoretical framework will I use to analyse the data? approach to EJ, what dimensions...
	- Am I focusing on a group of people, eg. women, elderly, ethnic minorities, working class... other?
	- Seems to me like it would be interesting to get the POV of minority/vulnerable residents, but how to do this with limited time, resources, and without targetting people as "vulnerable" or else?
	- Feel like my decisions are highly based on the papers I read, which is fine since this is what I know on the subject and I can't read everything - but what am I missing out on?
	- Won't the case study influence what RQ i choose? eg. Copenhagen vs. Madrid...?
	- Feasibility? maybe best bet is to go down distributional justice approach, not rely so much on qualitative data on human experiences
	- General questions about academia: how do you reconcile your research with what happens on the field, in the city planning offices, in communities? how much are people who have the power, exposed to this kind of research/environmental justice paradigms? thinking about what i'll do after uni... where can you actually have the most impact?
