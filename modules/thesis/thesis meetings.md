## Meeting notes

### may 11th - josh

General questions:
- I'm mostly interested in the opinions of the people who are not in the space i'm studying; concerned about having to infer who they are and why they're not present, without actually speaking to them.
- Research "nature" explanatory- explaining why a phenomenon occurs; but what if we don't know whether said phenomenon occurs, when we need to figure out if it occurs before we answer why or why not? --> eg. "why are blue spaces unfairly accessible in Copenhagen" assumes that there is unfair access; is "what is the accessibility of blue spaces in Copenhagen, and why are they or why are they not fairly accessible?"
- Can we put our case study within the RQ, or should the case city be abstracted away from the RQ ?

### april 27th
- Decided to focus on people's experiences
	- how a space is experienced/perceived by people who's access is restricted in some way, ultimately to understand:
		- how this shapes the way they use the space
		- why the barriers exist
		- how they can be overcome in the future
	- ref. diagram/written notes
- Theoretical framework - environmental justice
	- What dimension specifically? Liked critical approach of the traditional dimensions in [[@anguelovski2020expanding]], but what *specifically*?
	- Do I systematically have to analyse injustices? (eg. green gentrification/displacement, green exclusion... ref. [[@anguelovski2020expanding]])
	- ~~What is my approach to EJ? Should I find a set of dimensions (eg. diversity of users, and diversity of uses) and analyse them? Should I look for signs of injustice, as a way to prove or disprove that a space contributes to justince/injustice?

- Methods - mostly qualitative
	- PPGIS: qualitative data combined with spatial data, can analyse people's experiences, perceptions, uses of a space, and ask about their identities
	- OR mental mapping? allows people to express themselves without predefined categories/labels/interpretations
	- ALSO like idea of futuring, where people are free to invent alternative futures/new imaginaries of a space
	- BUT how to get access to the right individuals/communities? how to access the invisible? how much data is "too little data"? ethics?
	- Observational methods? but positionality, bias...
- Case study/comparative study:
	- I like the idea of comparisons, because it makes it easier (for me at least) to judge
	- I think a comparative study of cases in 2 different countries, where I have to collect data myself, will be a lot of work/hard because the collection will happen in 2 different semesters, one in the semester i have to finish the thesis
	- Maybe comparing two blue spaces in one city (Copenhagen?), and in two neighbourhoods with *distinct socio-economic demographics*?
	- Wdyt about Copenhagen as a case city? Don't want to research a place that's already been studied, but also practical to use it because 1. i will be there, 2. there are a lot of blue spaces, 3. northern europe known for its social welfare/equality, but its changing

- Main questions/general comments:

	- Liked the critical approach to EJ presented in [[@anguelovski2020expanding]]
	- What analytical/theoretical framework will I use to analyse the data? approach to EJ, what dimensions...
	- Am I focusing on a group of people, eg. women, elderly, ethnic minorities, working class... other?
		- [[@baro2021school]] socio-demographic indicators of social vulnerability: income, low education attainment, immigrants from global south
	- Seems to me like it would be interesting to get the POV of minority/vulnerable residents, but how to do this with limited time, resources, and without targetting people as "vulnerable" or else?
	- Feel like my decisions are highly based on the papers I read, which is fine since this is what I know on the subject and I can't read everything - but what am I missing out on?
	- Won't the case study influence what RQ i choose? eg. Copenhagen vs. Madrid...?
	- Feasibility? maybe best bet is to go down distributional justice approach, not rely so much on qualitative data on human experiences
	- General questions about academia: how do you reconcile your research with what happens on the field, in the city planning offices, in communities? how much are people who have the power, exposed to this kind of research/environmental justice paradigms? thinking about what i'll do after uni... where can you actually have the most impact?

- equity and access, 
- map based surveys/PPGIS- how to operationalise this, how to find them, what is the sample? 
- focus on swimming? benefits still felt when not in the water, but just nearby
- case studies
	- when can survey be designed and start circulating?
	- language?
	- circulation? go to specific space and interview people; impossible to have non-users, only do-able with a high-scale survey
- can i infer who isn't there based on who is?
	- ask motivation, what is variable for people to go there (eg. distance, proximity...), can infer who goes there/not based on their responses
- possibility- go to bs and get answers from users, go as far as possible away from the bs and ask them how they feel
- $\Rightarrow$ start with users in the blue spaces
- bluehealth- map based survey; maybe have contact? look at some examples of map-based surveys
- how small is too small? surveys (~) vs. interviews (qualitative, semi-structured, ~15-20 from one city)
	- interviews analysed from software, ~15-20 / city; with paper map? group of people drawing on a map, explaining themselves?
	- map-based survey requires more, ~200 at least more than 100, has to be SHORT
- framework? dependent on RQ; 
	- eg. perception, needs, values of users: perceived justice more about recognition of justice; 
	- eg framework: blue spaces in cities, their benefits, and how their value is perceived by people, framework of "benefits of green and blue spaces in cities", "nature based solution", "relationship nature health and wellbeing", justice part "recognition"
- **$\Rightarrow$ Design specific objectives and questions that are feasible to answer in methodological approach, which is realisable in a thesis**  
- Survey:
	- ask nationality/immigration background
	- statistical methods for analysis vs. surveys/interviews? -> at the end can still do something related to distributional justice mixed with perceptions and values -> eg. geotag social media data
	- ==Blue spaces with social media data??== 

- #todo RESEARCH PROPOSAL provide context of topic based on literature review (blue spaces, uses, perceptions, values) and say how you would contribute; state the research goals and objectives; methodological approach and case studies
	- tentative gann chart of thesis?
	- 1. draft questionaire and survey,
	- 2. interviews (time intensive),
	- 3. analysing
- Blue health publications on map-survey, and DECIDE on surveys with spatial component OR interviews
