## meeting notes


### november 23rd - francesc
- When non-users were interviewed (ie. people in public space inthe neighbourhood), they often referred to aspects of Nordhavn and not Sandkaj specifically, when trying to explain how they perceived it

### september 20th - francesc
- Previously done (august): 
	- conducted 15 interviews at the waterfront, started hearing the same things over and over again. Population is rather homogenous, danish/white young adults in the sun
	- Specific baths/beaches have a certain appeal
	- Is there a problem? I saw one large park in a South-western neighbourhood that had a small beach, and there were many non-white/danish families having picnics/bbq's there
	- Interesting that people at the waterfront don't perceive any issues that prevent some from using the space - they look around and say, no, this place is for everyone - but it is mainly young, white, tan, fit people who look like them, and they think 'this is everyone', because there might be some family or older couple on the other side of the harbour
- Currently done (september)
	- tweaked the interview guide to interview people away from the waterfront
- Need to do:
	- Get more interviews from the streets; there is a square behind my house where people sit and linger for ~10 minutes; there is a famous park nearby that is supposed to support "diversity" although in reality it doesn't do anything to address diversity and integration of immigrants
	- haven't worked on it in the last couple weeks since the semester started here
- What is missing?
	- RQ: "what perceptions ..."
	- Why is this important? --> most people interviewed want more spaces to be by the water and swim; especially as summers are getting hotter; however, the observed and interviewed population at the waterfront is homogeneous - white, danish, young. What about the rest of the population? The city is developing more opportunities to be near or in the water, notably in the Water Culture House development project which was decided after submission of ideas from the public. But this is located in the supercenter of the city, amongst the museums and monuments like the Opera house - no one from the more northern districts will go out of their way to visit this place, when they already don't go to the more intimiate, less show-y ones near their homes
	- It also seems like the harbour baths and beaches are located near new developments (eg. Nordhavn, Sluseholmen). Were they done for the people and the climate, or for raising the attractivity of the new neighbourhoods?
	- Furthermore, if the city is building more space but not understanding what it is people who are currently not using waterfronts, want from a waterfront, then the city will continue to exclude people in their (superficial?) efforts to democratise water
	- If Denmark, and Copenhagen specifically, is branding itself as a welcoming city strong on integration policies (indeed, many immigrants speak danish within X years of arriving), then it should also push efforts to create public waterfronts that cater to those from a non-Danish background, in order to introduce the possibilities of the city to every
- Actions
	- don't have to focus on specific project liek water culture hosue, but speak to city developers in general to see how they manage waterfronts
	- analysing and coding interviews
		- need to look into this! *nvivo* link from francesc??
		- and link from colleagues at VUB!
		- analyse and code based on research questions, take out what the main statements that are relevant from the research (key words)
		- in qualitative research, useful to identify quotes supporting thesis, (eg. people use the blue space)
		- point was to identify social barriers to use the space - maybe conclusion is that no? but hard to be representative, especially with qualitative approach. BUT could be interesting to do more interviews to other public space users (eg. green spaces, or recreational spaces)
		- and may be interesting to put questions in relation to green space - comparative between blue and green? BUT maybe people might not know about UBS, and just talk randomly if they haven't used them
		- if people don't use waterfronts in summer time, dig in to that and ask why not, but why they use green spaces
		- another option: interview people related to planning and management of blue spaces (eg. WCH); look at the policy, are there plans to expand the blue spaces?
		- this topic is interesting and can lead to conflicts, eg. in brussels creating new park in south of the city with a pond for swimming in principle, but some neighbours are not in favour
			- any conflicts? noise pollution; people swimming where it isn't allowed/delimited
		- go to a random green space and ask the users if they use/how they use the blue space; 
		- ==find residents of the neighbourhoods near the blue space and ask if they use it, or why/why not?==  are the UBS making the place more lively, insecure, trendy/attractive? --> focus on **residents!** 
	- --> 10 to 15 RESIDENT interviews (keeping focus on users) and TRANSCRIBE and start ANALYSIS (identify key quotes, familiarise with literature, try to familiarise with social sciences process)
	- POSTER SESSION - let know for feedback
	- For transcription, coding, analysis should be finished by EOY
	
### may
- Comparative studies between two blue spaces in Copenhagen, in two distinct neighbourhoods, with blue spaces that have had different amounts of investments (large investment in centre, vs. less investment in outer neighbourhoods)
	- Perceptions- who are the users (neighbourhood residents or visitors?), how do they identify with the space, why do they like, why do they come here...
	- => Ultimately, how do perceptions of the two blue spaces differ, and what does that tell us about the accessibility of blue spaces in the city?

### may - francesc
- Confused because everything seems to link back to distributional justice- eg. i study people who are using the space, their experiences, perceptions, that reveals a pattern of who they are and why they use it (eg. they live/work nearby, because they can afford to), and i just end up finding that those who use the space do so because it is near them and convenient. but of course that is true, and so the problem is that blue space conversion projects are concentrated in a certain area of the city, and not more disadvantaged/excentric neighbourhoods which might benefit more, and 

### may 11th - josh

General questions:
- I'm mostly interested in the opinions of the people who are not in the space i'm studying; concerned about having to infer who they are and why they're not present, without actually speaking to them
- Research "nature" explanatory- explaining why a phenomenon occurs; but what if we don't know whether said phenomenon occurs, when we need to figure out if it occurs before we answer why or why not? --> eg. "why are blue spaces unfairly accessible in Copenhagen" assumes that there is unfair access; is "what is the accessibility of blue spaces in Copenhagen, and why are they or why are they not fairly accessible?"
- Can we put our case study within the RQ, or should the case city be abstracted away from the RQ ?
- Why does it matter that I study perceptions/experiences/values/identities, rather than eg. distributional justice?
- Could do a comparative case between one harbour bath advertised by the city, and another in a more remote neighbourhood (ie. not as central)? -> understand who uses each space, how, and whether these differences are just or not

Discussions
- Iaskey Britton- relationship between blue areas and human settlements; looking at blue spaces in general
- Frameworks: climate adaptation and EJ are increasingly important in the city, and in this context there is urban green infrastructure (well developed concept), and also blue infrastructure which can work together, and also by themselves...
- work with 3-5 spaces of different types scattered accross the city, and identify users and uses/activities
- does making a space swimmable, alienate others, 
- how do people o feel, why do they use the space, what tdoe sit mean to them?
- Provide the theoretical framework to explain WHY it matters, and justify the empirical research -> why does the empirical research need to take place? -> climate adaptation/nature based solutions, environmental justice, blue green infrastructure...



### april 27th
- Decided to focus on people's experiences
	- how a space is experienced/perceived by people who's access is restricted in some way, ultimately to understand:
		- how this shapes the way they use the space
		- why the barriers exist
		- how they can be overcome in the future
	- ref. diagram/written notes
- Theoretical framework - environmental justice
	- What dimension specifically? Liked critical approach of the traditional dimensions in [[@anguelovski2020expanding]], but what *specifically*?
	- Do I systematically have to analyse injustices? (eg. green gentrification/displacement, green exclusion... ref. [[@anguelovski2020expanding]])
	- ~~What is my approach to EJ? Should I find a set of dimensions (eg. diversity of users, and diversity of uses) and analyse them? Should I look for signs of injustice, as a way to prove or disprove that a space contributes to justince/injustice?

- Methods - mostly qualitative
	- PPGIS: qualitative data combined with spatial data, can analyse people's experiences, perceptions, uses of a space, and ask about their identities
	- OR mental mapping? allows people to express themselves without predefined categories/labels/interpretations
	- ALSO like idea of futuring, where people are free to invent alternative futures/new imaginaries of a space
	- BUT how to get access to the right individuals/communities? how to access the invisible? how much data is "too little data"? ethics?
	- Observational methods? but positionality, bias...
- Case study/comparative study:
	- I like the idea of comparisons, because it makes it easier (for me at least) to judge
	- I think a comparative study of cases in 2 different countries, where I have to collect data myself, will be a lot of work/hard because the collection will happen in 2 different semesters, one in the semester i have to finish the thesis
	- Maybe comparing two blue spaces in one city (Copenhagen?), and in two neighbourhoods with *distinct socio-economic demographics*?
	- Wdyt about Copenhagen as a case city? Don't want to research a place that's already been studied, but also practical to use it because 1. i will be there, 2. there are a lot of blue spaces, 3. northern europe known for its social welfare/equality, but its changing

- Main questions/general comments:

	- Liked the critical approach to EJ presented in [[@anguelovski2020expanding]]
	- What analytical/theoretical framework will I use to analyse the data? approach to EJ, what dimensions...
	- Am I focusing on a group of people, eg. women, elderly, ethnic minorities, working class... other?
		- [[@baro2021school]] socio-demographic indicators of social vulnerability: income, low education attainment, immigrants from global south
	- Seems to me like it would be interesting to get the POV of minority/vulnerable residents, but how to do this with limited time, resources, and without targetting people as "vulnerable" or else?
	- Feel like my decisions are highly based on the papers I read, which is fine since this is what I know on the subject and I can't read everything - but what am I missing out on?
	- Won't the case study influence what RQ i choose? eg. Copenhagen vs. Madrid...?
	- Feasibility? maybe best bet is to go down distributional justice approach, not rely so much on qualitative data on human experiences
	- General questions about academia: how do you reconcile your research with what happens on the field, in the city planning offices, in communities? how much are people who have the power, exposed to this kind of research/environmental justice paradigms? thinking about what i'll do after uni... where can you actually have the most impact?

- equity and access, 
- map based surveys/PPGIS- how to operationalise this, how to find them, what is the sample? 
- focus on swimming? benefits still felt when not in the water, but just nearby
- case studies
	- when can survey be designed and start circulating?
	- language?
	- circulation? go to specific space and interview people; impossible to have non-users, only do-able with a high-scale survey
- can i infer who isn't there based on who is?
	- ask motivation, what is variable for people to go there (eg. distance, proximity...), can infer who goes there/not based on their responses
- possibility- go to bs and get answers from users, go as far as possible away from the bs and ask them how they feel
- $\Rightarrow$ start with users in the blue spaces
- bluehealth- map based survey; maybe have contact? look at some examples of map-based surveys
- how small is too small? surveys (~) vs. interviews (qualitative, semi-structured, ~15-20 from one city)
	- interviews analysed from software, ~15-20 / city; with paper map? group of people drawing on a map, explaining themselves?
	- map-based survey requires more, ~200 at least more than 100, has to be SHORT
- framework? dependent on RQ; 
	- eg. perception, needs, values of users: perceived justice more about recognition of justice; 
	- eg framework: blue spaces in cities, their benefits, and how their value is perceived by people, framework of "benefits of green and blue spaces in cities", "nature based solution", "relationship nature health and wellbeing", justice part "recognition"
- **$\Rightarrow$ Design specific objectives and questions that are feasible to answer in methodological approach, which is realisable in a thesis**  
- Survey:
	- ask nationality/immigration background
	- statistical methods for analysis vs. surveys/interviews? -> at the end can still do something related to distributional justice mixed with perceptions and values -> eg. geotag social media data
	- ==Blue spaces with social media data??== 

- #todo RESEARCH PROPOSAL provide context of topic based on literature review (blue spaces, uses, perceptions, values) and say how you would contribute; state the research goals and objectives; methodological approach and case studies
	- tentative gann chart of thesis?
	- 1. draft questionaire and survey,
	- 2. interviews (time intensive),
	- 3. analysing
- Blue health publications on map-survey, and DECIDE on surveys with spatial component OR interviews
