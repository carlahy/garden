## April 27th
- Decided to focus on people's experiences of a blue space
	- 
- Methods
	- Liked the paper on PPGIS and EV ([[@raymond2016integrating]])
- Environmental justice
	- What is my approach to EV? Should I find a set of dimensions (eg. diversity of users, and diversity of uses) and analyse them? Should I look for signs of injustice, as a way to prove or disprove that a space contributes to justince/injustice?
	- Do I have to systematically analyse injustices? (eg. green gentrification/displacement, green exclusion... ref. [[@anguelovski2020expanding]])
- Case study/comparative study:
	- I think a comparative study of cases in 2 different countries, where I have to collect data myself, will be a lot of work/hard because the collection will happen in 2 different semesters, one in the semester i have to finish the thesis
	- Maybe comparing two blue spaces in one city (Copenhagen?), and in two neighbourhoods with *distinct socio-economic demographics*?
	- Wdyt about Copenhagen as a case city? Don't want to research a place that's already been studied, but also practical to use it because 1. i will be there, 2. there are a lot of blue spaces, 3. northern europe known for its social welfare/equality, but its changing 
- Main questions:
	- How am I approaching EV, what dimensions do I want to focus on?
	- Am I choosing an approach to EV based on what I'm reading and what I know, rather than asking myself what I really want to know?
	- Am I focusing on a group of people, eg. women, elderly, ethnic minorities, other?
	- Seems to me like it would be interesting to get the POV of minority/vulnerable residents, but how to do this with limited time, resources, and without targetting people as "vulnerable" or else?
	- Won't the case study influence what RQ i choose?
	- General questions about academia: how do you reconcile your research with what happens on the field, in the city planning offices, in communities? how much are people who have the power, exposed to this kind of research/environmental justice paradigms? thinking about what i'll do after uni... where can you actually have the most impact?
