### draft 1:
1. Benefits of urban blueing, blue spaces, exposure to them [[@garrett2019urban]]
2. Thus, blue spaces can contribute to environmental justice
3. What is environmental justice? traditional conceptions are distributive, recognition, participatory
4. What are the limits of these definitions? [[@anguelovski2020expanding]], another paper focused on justice
5. How can these definitions be expanded to be more critical, and ultimately, just, when it comes to environmental justice? [[@anguelovski2020expanding]]

### draft 2:
1. Most cities have some kind of blue space
2. These waters were damaged by urbanisation and industry since the 19th century
3. Cities are now revitalising waters and waterfronts, following environmental concerns (eg. international pressure, climate change mitigation like heat sinks) or public demands (eg. people concerned about envrionment, recognising their right to clean public space)
4. Urban planning projects to revitalise, rehabilitate, reconnect urban water and waterfronts- includes *"pollution mitigation, coastal restoration, climage change adaptation, rezoning, economic development, and increased public access to waterfront areas"* (ref. toomey2021place)

### draft 3:

1. Most cities have a water body, be it inland like a river, lake, pond, harbour, or other fresh waters, or non-inland like salt water, coasts and beaches
3. The water is important to the city. It serves as a life source, a communication channel, a motor for industry and the economy, for recreation and exercise, for cultural and spiritual practice, and for community forming and belonging
	1. ref. [[@toomey2021place]] on community identity at a polluted/degraded blue space
	2. ref. [[@van2021urban]] on community engagement, feelings of belonging, safety
4. Through urbanisation, water in cities has become polluted, disrupting the relationship of people with waterfronts and their natural environments
5. In the last few decades, the rising environmental and climate concerns have sensibilised people to the importance of water in the city. With (international) political pressure and public demand, governments have invested significant resources in rehabilitating waterfronts into attractive places to swim and linger at
6. These projects prove to be valuable for a multitude of reasons. 
7. First, urban blue space, much like urban green space, has the power to improve people's physical and psychological wellbeing
	1.  Qualitative studies of health and wellbeing benefits of blue space --> ref. [[@garrett2019urban]] on exposure to water improving mental health of older adults in Hong Kong, regardless of whether or not the adults intentionally interacted with the water or just saw it from their apartment window; specific context of Hong Kong as an island with high quality transit and relatively safe public space
	2. Many quantitative studies of health and wellbeing effects of blue space --> ref. [[@gascon2017outdoor]] on summarising the effects blue spaces have on health and wellbeing. Effects are similar than that of green spaces, and help *"stress reduction, increased physical activity, promotion of positive social contacts, increased place attachment and the reduction of extreme temperatures"* (p. 1212)
8. Second, in the context of climate change, blue spaces play a crucial role in mitigating heat stress
	1. Blue spaces act as heat sinks (ref. [[@lin2020water]])
	2. Blue and green spaces can work alongside each other, and in tandem
9. Third, waterfronts provide people with the opportunity to connect with each other, and with nature
	1. Individuals and communities can have a strong sense of place associated with waterfronts --> ref. [[@toomey2021place]] even degraded and polluted waterfronts can play a central role in communities
	2. Waterfront revitalisation projects can be an opportunity to create community bonds by engaging residents in the design and building process. In the "urban acupuncture" intervention conducted by BlueHealth in a deprived area of Plymouth, UK, residents who participated in the project reported a greater sense of wellbeing and life satisfaction due to feelings of community belonging and safety (ref. [[@van2021urban]])
	3. On the flip side, when the local community's perceptions and values are not understood by the planners, revitalisations can disrupt human-to-human or human-to-water contact. (ref. [[@toomey2021place]]). In perverse cases, cities prioritise growth rather than wellbeing and community (todo:ref). With "flashy glitzy green (blue)" (todo:ref) infrastructure like the XPROJECT in CITYX, cities try to attract a new creative class rather than addressing public blue spaces as a common good, and prioritising the concerns of existing residents (ref. [[@wessells2014urban]])
10. Public blue spaces are a shared, common good, that everyone should be able to access
	1. ref. [[@wessells2014urban]] right to the city enabled through blue space 
11. 
12. Fair access to blue spaces, and their 


### themes:
- blue spaces for health and wellbeing, improved quality of life, recreation
	- 
- people and the space
	- diversity of engagement with waterfronts (toomey2021place)
	- people create a sense of place, a relationship, associated to waterfronts (toomey2021place)
	- it is often assumed that waterfronts degraded by pollution or industry do not hold values for the local communities, and must be revitalised; however, need to be careful not to disrupt potential sense of place, attachement, and to listen to the local, often marginalised, communities' relationships with and perspective of the water; planners need to engage with socio-ecological connections (toomey2021place)
- climate adaption and climate resilience through nature based solutions
	- blue spaces as heat sinks
- design of blue spaces
	- designs that encourage a diversity of use (ref. copenhagen waterfront manual)
- environmental justice, social justice
	- 
- increasing gentrification
	- social and cultural displacement
	- lowest classes even worse off because deprived of public spaces that provide mental wellbeing
- privileging some people/communities' preferences or relationships to the water over others
	- supporting or disrupting sense of place (toomey2021place)

### literature review

Urban blue spaces have a positive impact on people’s perceived mental and physical well-being - being near water makes people feel better and happier, and be more active (Gascon et al. 2017). In particular, blue spaces have the potential to have an even greater influence on the wellbeing of those living in socio-economically disadvantaged neighbourhoods, due to low socio-economic status being linked to poorer mental health and lower life satisfaction (van den Bogerd et al. 2021).

Most European cities have at least one natural blue space like a river, lake, harbour or canal. Due to urbanisation, water bodies have been polluted or transformed by industries and became unsafe to swim (Kampa et al. 2016). Through public pressure or for environmental concerns, cities have invested resources into cleaning and restoring water and waterfronts into attractive natural places for people to enjoy. Making a body of water swimmable is a large public investment: the water itself has to be cleaned, which involves identifying and dealing with polluting sources; the waterbed and surrounding environments have to be rehabilitated to safely welcome people; and the waterfront has to be equipped with infrastructure for swimming, sitting, walking, and more. Since public space is a highly valued commodity in a city, reconverting blue spaces is a great way to take advantage of unused areas.

Moreover, public spaces do not have an entrance fee, which removes an economic barrier to access. However, this doesn’t imply that they are fairly accessible to everyone. The first reason why some people may not be able to use a blue space is physical accessibility. Those who are most likely to frequent a blue space are those living or working in the vicinity. The availability of public transport, bicycle infrastructure, the quality of the roads and footpaths around and in the space, also influence who visits. The second reason is psychological accessibility. Blue spaces (and public spaces in general) can be more or less welcoming to certain groups of people. Gender, age, ethnicity, income, or preferences in aesthetics or activities, amongst other factors, influence who feels welcomed or attracted to a space. Discriminatory practices exclude people and groups; for example, being made to feel like spending money is necessary to fit in excludes people based on their socio-economic class (Wessells 2014).

Therefore, even if a blue space is free and open to the public, this does not mean that people use and benefit from them fairly. Understanding this phenomenon is important because public spaces are places of community, identity and attachment, and everyone in the city should have equal rights to them (Agyeman et al. 2016). Every blue space, neighbourhood and city will have a different set of conditions (social, political, economic, cultural, environmental, etc.) which explain who uses the space, how they feel in it, and why they use it. In order to uncover these conditions, the unit of analysis should be scoped to a specific location on the water where people linger and have the opportunity to swim; this spot should have been rehabilitated by the city, and be public; and, it would be particularly interesting to study two rehabilitated blue spaces within one city, in order to compare the social consequences of investments in different neighbourhoods.
