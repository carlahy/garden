# literature review

### draft

1. Most large cities situated on bodies of water, whether it is inland like a river, lake, pond, or harbour, or salt water on the coasts.
3. Water is important to the city. It serves as a life source, a communication channel, a motor for industry and the economy, for recreation and exercise, for cultural and spiritual practice, and for community forming and belonging.
	1. ref. [[@toomey2021place]] on community identity at a polluted/degraded blue space
	2. ref. [[@van2021urban]] on community engagement, feelings of belonging, safety
4. Through urbanisation, water in cities has become polluted, disrupting the relationship of people with waterfronts and their natural environments
5. In the last few decades, the rising environmental and climate concerns have sensibilised people to the importance of water in the city. With (international) political pressure and public demand, governments have invested significant resources in rehabilitating waterfronts into attractive places to swim and linger at
6. Projects to rehabilitate blue spaces into environments that are attractive for people to spend time at or in the water, prove to be valuable for a multitude of reasons. 
7. First, in the context of climate change, blue spaces play a crucial role in mitigating pollution, heat stress, etc., similarly to green spaces
	1. Blue spaces act as heat sinks (ref. [[@lin2020water]])
	2. Blue and green spaces can work alongside each other, and in tandem
	3. Urban planning projects to revitalise, rehabilitate, reconnect urban water and waterfronts- includes *"pollution mitigation, coastal restoration, climage change adaptation, rezoning, economic development, and increased public access to waterfront areas"* (ref. [[@toomey2021place]])
8. Second, blue space has the ability to improve people's physical and psychological wellbeing. Being exposed to water makes people feel better, happier, and be more active (ref. [[@gascon2017outdoor]]), similar impacts that green spaces offer. 
	1.  Qualitative studies of health and wellbeing benefits of blue space --> ref. [[@garrett2019urban]] on exposure to water improving mental health of older adults in Hong Kong, regardless of whether or not the adults intentionally interacted with the water or just saw it from their apartment window; specific context of Hong Kong as an island with high quality transit and relatively safe public space
	2. Many quantitative studies of health and wellbeing effects of blue space --> ref. [[@gascon2017outdoor]] on summarising the effects blue spaces have on health and wellbeing. Effects are similar than that of green spaces, and help *"stress reduction, increased physical activity, promotion of positive social contacts, increased place attachment and the reduction of extreme temperatures"* (p. 1212)
	3. In deprived areas in particular, people tend to have poorer mental health and lower life satisfaction compared to more privileged areas (ref. [[@van2021urban]]). Revitalising blue spaces in these areas to increase access to high quality waterfronts has the potential to have an even greater influence on the wellbeing of those living in socio-economically disadvantaged neighbourhoods.
10. Third, waterfronts provide people with the opportunity to connect with each other, and with nature
	1. Individuals and communities can have a strong sense of place associated with waterfronts --> ref. [[@toomey2021place]] even degraded and polluted waterfronts can play a central role in communities
	2. Waterfront revitalisation projects can be an opportunity to create community bonds by engaging residents in the design and building process. In the "urban acupuncture" intervention conducted by BlueHealth in a deprived area of Plymouth, UK, residents who participated in the project reported a greater sense of wellbeing and life satisfaction due to feelings of community belonging and safety (ref. [[@van2021urban]])
11. Despite the undeniable benefits of urban blue spaces, revitalisation projects can have consequences on people and the environment
	1. In contrast to the social community benefits that can be built by involving the residents in a revitalisation project, when the local community's perceptions and values are not understood by the planners, revitalisation can disrupt human-to-human or human-to-water contact. (ref. [[@toomey2021place]]). In perverse cases, cities prioritise growth rather than wellbeing and community (ref. [[@wessells2014urban]]). With "flashy glitzy green (blue)" (todo:ref) infrastructure like the XPROJECT in CITYX, cities try to attract a new creative class rather than addressing public blue spaces as a common good, and prioritising the concerns of existing residents (ref. [[@wessells2014urban]]). 
	2. Through projects such as these, the values of others are privileged over the values of existing residents who risk displacement. Those who can afford to live near blue/green spaces will move in and price out the lower classes who will be forced to move to neighbourhoods with lower access to attractive blue space, thereby reducing inequalities, but at the same time, attractive blue space causes gentrification. (todo:REF OF GENTRIFICATION PAPER)
13. How do we make sure, then, that everyone in the city can benefit from high quality blue spaces, equally? Given cities' pride and promotion of their waterfronts, and the numerous qualitative and quantitative studies on the benefits that water has on people, the qualities of blue spaces are well known by governments, planning offices and academics. On the other hand, the social and environmental consequences of revitalisation projects are not always understood or taken into account by planners. If cities are to reduce inequalities regarding access to natural spaces, any revitalisation project needs to understand social and environmental consequences and trade-offs attached.
14. Environmental justice
	1. Environmental justice is a multi-faceted concept which brings together social and environmental concerns. Amongst other things, it advocates for the equitable access to environmental benefits. Justice is widely broken down into three dimensions: distributional justice, procedural justice, and recognition justice. (todo:cite schlosberg)
	2. Distributional justice focuses where blue spaces are situated in the city and whether they address social, economic, racial or ethnic inequalities by attempting to "avoid displacement and new negative green, ecological, climate and health effects" ([[@anguelovski2020expanding]]) on disadavantaged populations.
	3. Procedural justice deals with questions of discrimination in public participation and decision making situations. Nonetheless, even ideal participation doesn't prevent spaces from being captured by gentrifiers\footnote{urban community gardens}.
	4. Recognition justice addresses individuals and communities’ perceptions, values and preferences which may influence the ways in which they interact, or not, with public space (ref. [[@anguelovski2020expanding]])
		1. Marginalised or stigmitised communities may find it hard or impossible to communicate their experience to the mainstream because they lack the words to articulate their reality. And vice-versa, white, heteronormative societies may not be capable of appreciating the experience of others. This of course does not mean that minority communities do not attach meaning to place, but that groups with distinct value systems need a common language to communicate. To this end, Toomey et al. propose using language like "place-disruption" and "place-protection" to promote mutual understanding and avoid privileging the values of mainstream groups over those of marginalised communities.
		2. To recognising minority communities also requires understanding Aspects of life being done in private sphere, not visible publicly, therefore not normalised- especially muslim women, invisible work/care work... (ref. [[@wessells2014urban]])
	5. These three dimensions of envrionmental justice have been extensively used by scholars to understand (in)justices linked to blue green spaces. Taking this traditional framework of environmental justice further, Anguelovski et al. propose two goals to advance the concept of justice: 1, uncovering the material and immaterial power, and 2, advancing new principles for equity in urban greening.  ==explain these concepts==
	6. Importance of situating 
14. Right to the city enabled through public blue space (in connection to recognition justice)
	1. Public blue spaces are a shared, common good, that everyone should be able to acces (ref. [[@wessells2014urban]])
	2. todo:cite more right to the city literature
	3. Sharing the benefits that waterfronts have on people and the environment

### literature review

Urban blue spaces have a positive impact on people’s perceived mental and physical well-being - being near water makes people feel better and happier, and be more active (Gascon et al. 2017). In particular, blue spaces have the potential to have an even greater influence on the wellbeing of those living in socio-economically disadvantaged neighbourhoods, due to low socio-economic status being linked to poorer mental health and lower life satisfaction (van den Bogerd et al. 2021).

Most European cities have at least one natural blue space like a river, lake, harbour or canal. Due to urbanisation, water bodies have been polluted or transformed by industries and became unsafe to swim (Kampa et al. 2016). Through public pressure or for environmental concerns, cities have invested resources into cleaning and restoring water and waterfronts into attractive natural places for people to enjoy. Making a body of water swimmable is a large public investment: the water itself has to be cleaned, which involves identifying and dealing with polluting sources; the waterbed and surrounding environments have to be rehabilitated to safely welcome people; and the waterfront has to be equipped with infrastructure for swimming, sitting, walking, and more. Since public space is a highly valued commodity in a city, reconverting blue spaces is a great way to take advantage of unused areas.

Moreover, public spaces do not have an entrance fee, which removes an economic barrier to access. However, this doesn’t imply that they are fairly accessible to everyone. The first reason why some people may not be able to use a blue space is physical accessibility. Those who are most likely to frequent a blue space are those living or working in the vicinity. The availability of public transport, bicycle infrastructure, the quality of the roads and footpaths around and in the space, also influence who visits. The second reason is psychological accessibility. Blue spaces (and public spaces in general) can be more or less welcoming to certain groups of people. Gender, age, ethnicity, income, or preferences in aesthetics or activities, amongst other factors, influence who feels welcomed or attracted to a space. Discriminatory practices exclude people and groups; for example, being made to feel like spending money is necessary to fit in excludes people based on their socio-economic class (Wessells 2014).

Therefore, even if a blue space is free and open to the public, this does not mean that people use and benefit from them fairly. Understanding this phenomenon is important because public spaces are places of community, identity and attachment, and everyone in the city should have equal rights to them (Agyeman et al. 2016). Every blue space, neighbourhood and city will have a different set of conditions (social, political, economic, cultural, environmental, etc.) which explain who uses the space, how they feel in it, and why they use it. In order to uncover these conditions, the unit of analysis should be scoped to a specific location on the water where people linger and have the opportunity to swim; this spot should have been rehabilitated by the city, and be public; and, it would be particularly interesting to study two rehabilitated blue spaces within one city, in order to compare the social consequences of investments in different neighbourhoods.
