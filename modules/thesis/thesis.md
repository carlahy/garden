### methods
Ref: #thesis-method 
- Selecting methods ([[spring school]])
	- Don't work backwards from the methods towards a question - first question, then find most fitting methods
	- Ask what can this method not get me?
	- Recency bias
	- What can be known, and how can it be known? Epistimologies
	- Philosophising about method selection, what it can do for your research
- **Comparative study**
	- Don't want to do cases in 2 different countries; maybe 2 different specific blue spaces in one city (Copenhagen) but...
	- What are the benefits of comparison? to have a reference
	- What cases? 2 specific, bounded blue spaces in Copenhagen to be able to approach users and conduct interviews
	- Feasibility?

	- Suggestions for improvement of negative experiences of space
	- What choudl it be useful for?
	- What expertise required?
	- Feasibility?
		- Will I be able to get significant enough data
	- What type of RQ/hypothesis can it answer?

- mental mapping
	- place attachment, understanding whether a place is (or isn't) part of someone's everyday 
- futuring exercises

	- What could it be useful for?
	- What expertise required?
	- What data sets?
	- Feasibility?
	- What type of RQ/hypothesis can it answer?

- futuring

### objectives

Ideas to analyse blue space and EJ:

1. ==distributional EJ== the location of the project in the city - the surrounding neighbourhoods and who lives there, accessibility by public transport/walking/cycling and time required to reach the water from different parts of the city
- YES/NO?
- Methods:
	- Quantitative analysis: socio-economic data, distance to blue spaces, distribution of blue spaces (on average/for each district or census tract how far away do people live from blue spaces?)

2. ==view/perspective of planners/designers of public space== the built environment and the design of the space - how inclusive/accessible/safe is the space for people of different ages/genders/income/ethnicities/abilities; it would be great to talk to the planners to know if/how they built for a diversity of users and uses
- NO: difficulty in accessing planners; language barriers; no experience in planning;
- Methods: ???

3. ==use patterns, perceptions, values of users== who uses the space, how do they use it, and how do they feel - are the users a diverse group of people, do they feel welcome and safe, what time of day/week/year is the space used, who _isn't_ using the space; could do this with repeated observation of a space and 1-1 interviews (eg. similar to [https://bluehealth2020.eu/projects/besos-river/](https://bluehealth2020.eu/projects/besos-river/))
- YES: interested in people's experiences and perception of space, who uses it, how they use it
- Methods:
	- 1-1 user interviews: semi-structured interview, offline PPGIS,
	- Observations: ethnography, eg. [bluehealth besos river](https://bluehealth2020.eu/projects/besos-river/) 
	- Could re-use methodology and framework from [[@raymond2016integrating]], where they use multiple dimensions of EJ (diversity of users, of uses, and PPUE) and use PPGIS (or an off-line equivalent, by approaching people directly, and focusing on one/two specific blue spaces in 1 city (maybe easier than two cities in two different countries?))

$\rightarrow$ narrow down your specific objectives and already start thinking about the methods that you will use for each

#### narrowed objective**s**
General:
- understand people's perceptions and experiences of a blue space, in order to analyse whether the space is "environmentally just" #todo replace with a dimension of EV, eg. "whose uses and needs are supported", "who has access to the space"... maybe select an RQ from [[@anguelovski2020expanding]] 
- method: community based PPGIS, which could give me spatial and experiential data
