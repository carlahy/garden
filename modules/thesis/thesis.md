### notes september 2022
- extra ideas todo:
	- can i compare home prices and distance from the waterfront/swimming spot? maybe historically?
	- instagram tags of sandkaj harbour bath
- topics of discussion/literature
	- 'welfare-city' of copenhagen in connection with environmental justice; how does one inscribe itself in the other?
	- urban transition processes
	- **green gentrification** - You cannot really speak about gentrification in Nordhavn, because the neighbourhood is being built from the ground up since the last decade. Thus, no one has been displaced, and the neighbourhood is built for middle and upper classes, meaning that there is no room for socially disadvantaged communities to be there.
	- **governance** - from research proposal, "These barriers are influenced by institutional context, ie. the `formal and informal rules of a governance system that shapes human choices, behaviours and interactions` (Wolff et al. 2022)" ref [[@wolff2022conceptualizing]]
	- why there is such a **uniform** vision
- Nordhavn 
	- Seeing a similar transformation as Islands Brygge, which was the first harbour bath to open in Copenhagen (2002, by the mayor who wanted to show the cleanliness of the water; people thought they wouldn't be used extensively (?)). An industrial site that transformed into an attractive neighbourhood
	- "But this sustainable utopia isn’t without its flaws. Even with a small amount of social housing on offer, its sky-high property prices – around 3.5 times higher than the rest of Copenhagen – have earnt it the nickname `rich man’s ghetto`" - [independent article][https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/sustainable-living/copenhagen-nordhavn-neighbourhood-guide-sustainable-b1970816.html], ref. @ganatra_2021
	- "“At the start, it was easy to say you want mixed social make-up, but then it’s a very attractive neighbourhood, so investors have been able to do good business here,” says Stubbergaard. “So it’s not socially sustainable yet, in my eyes. But during the six years since building this area, we’ve implemented the idea that 25 per cent of the houses we build on the other islands in Nordhavn have to be social housing.”"
		- If they haven't been able to integrate social housing in the initial stage of the project, why would the rest of the development be any different? If they were serious about social sustainability, the developers would have considered affordable, subsidised housing as a pillar of the project and proved their commitment with the opening of the first redeveloped area. Instead, the social housing will be pushed to the edges of the harbour, which are now either a construction zone, or do not exist yet as land is reclaimed. This approach repeats a pattern seen in virtually all cities today: the socially disadvantaged are pushed to the margins of the city, away from the attractive urban areas reserved for consumption and tourism.
	- I initially set out to understand *how people's perceptions of the harbour baths in Copenhagen could influence usability*. I interviewed circa 15 users across the city, in Sandkaj, Svanemolle, Amager Strand and Sluseholmen. There was a pattern in the users, and their answers: mostly young, Danish couples and friends, who cycle for 10 to 20 minutes to reach their preferred swimming and sunbathing spots. They describe their favourite spots as 'hygge', or cosy, they have never had an unpleasant experience besides perhaps overcrowding, and they don't see how anyone could face any issues that prevent them from coming, or using the waterfront in the ways they would like. 'Look around you, there is all kinds of people here', one interviewee mentioned on a crowded summer evening at the Sandkaj harbour bath. This observation wasn't wrong, per se. There were older adults, families and little kids, if you looked. But this is not real diversity. You can see and feel the homogeneity of the Copenhageners at Sandkaj, yet the reality of the city is different. TODO(stats about diversity).
	- Thus, the waterfront users provided a perspective on the harbour bath that ignored the obviousness that a large population is missing in this space, even on the hottest days of the year. 
	- Why is it so? Does the profile of Nordhavn tell us anything about the users and use patterns of the harbour bath? Only 15 minutes away on the bike is the neighbourhood Norrebro, known for its cultural, ethnic, religious diversity, and notoriously known for crime and 'gang violence'. This diversity or 'edge' is not present in Nordhavn, by design. Homogeneity has been built in to the neigbhourhood planned for middle and upper classes. It is on average 3.5 times more expensive to live here than the rest of the cite \ref{?}, and is referred to in the media as a `rich man's ghetto` \ref{?}. Social mix was touted by developers in the initial plan but visible only for appearances because today, there are no subsidised apartments in Nordhavn. Four fifths remain to be developed, so perhaps affordable homes will exist in the future, but if planners haven't been able to integrate social housing in the initial stage of the project, why would the rest be any different?
	- Perhaps it is because Danish culture revolves around water. As one interviewee mentionned, "we [Denmark] are a small country but we have 70,000 km of coast, so we like to go to the sea and look out". The swimming profiency of Danes is virtually 100%, and children learn early, daring to dive head first off the highest level of the diving board. In contrast, other cultures may not feel as comfortable in the water. Although there are shallow pools for children, parents may feel uncomfortable or unsafe coming to the water.
	

	- https://nordhavn-avis.dk/subnordhavn-avis/nordhavn/609-sandkaj-slog-alle-tre-havnebade-i-besog --> In the summer of 2020, post strict-lockdown measures, Sandkaj was the most popular harbour bath in the city. It had more visitors than three other, more central  baths had combined, namely Fisketorvet, Islands Brygge and Sluseholmen. People also bathed illegally outside the designed areas, which resulted in police interventions and fines. 

### methods
Ref: #thesis-method 
- Selecting methods ([[spring school]])
	- Don't work backwards from the methods towards a question - first question, then find most fitting methods
	- Ask what can this method not get me?
	- Recency bias
	- What can be known, and how can it be known? Epistimologies
	- Philosophising about method selection, what it can do for your research
- **Comparative study**
	- Don't want to do cases in 2 different countries; maybe 2 different specific blue spaces in one city (Copenhagen) but...
	- What are the benefits of comparison? to have a reference
	- What cases? 2 specific, bounded blue spaces in Copenhagen to be able to approach users and conduct interviews
	- Feasibility?

- Blue health SoftGIS: https://bluehealth2020.eu/projects/softgis/ and Barcelona example https://app.maptionnaire.com/en/2313/ 


### case studies

### objectives

Ideas to analyse [[blue space]] and EJ:

1. ==distributional EJ== the location of the project in the city - the surrounding neighbourhoods and who lives there, accessibility by public transport/walking/cycling and time required to reach the water from different parts of the city
- YES/NO?
- Methods:
	- Quantitative analysis: socio-economic data, distance to blue spaces, distribution of blue spaces (on average/for each district or census tract how far away do people live from blue spaces?)

2. ==view/perspective of planners/designers of public space== the built environment and the design of the space - how inclusive/accessible/safe is the space for people of different ages/genders/income/ethnicities/abilities; it would be great to talk to the planners to know if/how they built for a diversity of users and uses
- NO: difficulty in accessing planners; language barriers; no experience in planning;
- Methods: ???

3. ==use patterns, perceptions, values of users== who uses the space, how do they use it, and how do they feel - are the users a diverse group of people, do they feel welcome and safe, what time of day/week/year is the space used, who _isn't_ using the space; could do this with repeated observation of a space and 1-1 interviews (eg. similar to [https://bluehealth2020.eu/projects/besos-river/](https://bluehealth2020.eu/projects/besos-river/))
- YES: interested in people's experiences and perception of space, who uses it, how they use it
- Methods:
	- 1-1 user interviews: semi-structured interview, offline PPGIS,
	- Observations: ethnography, eg. [bluehealth besos river](https://bluehealth2020.eu/projects/besos-river/) 
	- Could re-use methodology and framework from [[@raymond2016integrating]], where they use multiple dimensions of EJ (diversity of users, of uses, and PPUE) and use PPGIS (or an off-line equivalent, by approaching people directly, and focusing on one/two specific blue spaces in 1 city (maybe easier than two cities in two different countries?))

$\rightarrow$ narrow down your specific objectives and already start thinking about the methods that you will use for each

#### narrowed objectives
General:
- understand people's perceptions and experiences of a blue space, in order to analyse whether the space is "environmentally just" #todo replace with a dimension of EV, eg. "whose uses and needs are supported", "who has access to the space"... maybe select an RQ from [[@anguelovski2020expanding]] 
- method: community based PPGIS, which could give me spatial and experiential data
