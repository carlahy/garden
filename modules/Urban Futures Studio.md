[Transdisciplinary field guide](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/transdisciplinary-field-guide)

- An experimental unit
- Moving beyond from extractive research (eg. data extraction from surveys), but rather make it cyclical
- Using alternative techniques
- TINA (there is no alternative) - false!
	- Visualising different urban futures through different coloured lenses

>If you would work at the Urban Futures Studio, how would you programme its activities?
- Thinking about creating *many* futures, creating a tree-like structure, starting from one alternative, which branches out into many alternatives
- A collaborative exercise
- Integration indigeneous knowledge
- Inviting scientists to witness the discussions and 'soft' methods

#### Studying social change
- Comprehending social change and how it works is challenging
- How can we study what has not yet happened?
- **Futuring**: attempts at shaping the space for action by identifying and circulating images of the future, a process by which relationship between past, present and future are enacted
	- Futuring for sustainability: trying to get a handle on urban politics by looking how the 'future' features in the search for sustainable cities
	- Cultural pathways: finding culture shifts of doing, being
- **Imaginaries**: collectively held and performed visions of desirable futures

#### Futuring
- 1939 Futurama world expo: pavilions by countries and by large industries (eg. General Motors), following the trend of commercial, capitalist United States; pavilions based on escaping the city by living in the suburbs (alternatives, allow people to imagine what could be their lives) -> futuring 'par excellence', a racial concept (escaping communities living in the inner city)
	- Advertising a desirable/enviable future
	- Governments and industries *made* the future as imagined, inevitable

How to know the future?
- Will look like: prediction
- Might look like: projection and scenarios
- Could look like: opening up
- Should look like: normative interventions

What we think is possible, or impossible, isn't the only alternative. We are constrained about what is difficult to imagined, and what is *unthinkable*.

#### COnclusions
- Tend to see the future according to own, recent, contextualised understandings of the present
- Futuring: happens everywhere; social practice that combines forms of knowledge; *unequal*, different types of futuring have different effects on what types of futures we can imagine and plan for, and who is included; => need to help define how we can bring urban futures that are ecologically sounds and socially just


#### Post fossil city
- imagining the post-fossil city as a green and just city
- need to rethink: energy sources, mobility, shelter, food -> the entire urban existence 
- #book *Neighbourhoods for the Future - A Plea for Social and Ecological Urbanism*
	- Re-imagining cities from the neighbourhood up
	- Examples of the post-fossil city, how it works, and why it works

#### Neighbourhoods 
-  Small enough to be tangible, big enough to make a difference
- Thriving neigbhourhoods create thriving cities (collection of units making the whole)
- Neighbourhood ecology: the component parts (services, nodes for exchange, mateiral infrastructures) that, in their interaction make a neighbourhood into a 'good' neigbhourhood
- Neighbourhood arrangement:
	- Discourse: ensembles of ideas, concepts, categories through which meaning is given; shared language and storylines
	- Actors: sense of ownership, long-term interest; knowing the neighbourhood
	- Resources: financial sustainability; *neigbhourhood value chain* => keeping value in the neighbourhood
	- Rules: urban code; simplicity and stability -> not being too directive, which erodes creativity


> What could you, as a planner, do to create a neigbhbourhood value chain?
- Legal provision; ownernship structures; development rights; selection procedures; financial instruments; partipatory logics; oversight mechanisms

- Retain financial and social value of neighbourhood, while avoiding privatisation of public-domain over the neighbourhoods

Brainstorming: Community Neighbourhood Trust
- legal provision
- ownernship structures: land owned by the trust, housing owned by residents
- development rights: rights given by the board
- selection procedures: for residents and businesses
- financial instruments: businesses pay rent and 'solidarity fund' (tax), used for developments; resident rent (but low)
- partipatory logics: board; resident approval for new projects; reception centre (community centre)
- oversight mechanisms: multitude of commitees (culture, education)
- there's a board:
	- decides if a business is needed or valuable for the neighbourhood, or if it introduces too much competition

#### Discussions
- Ownership
	- Shared ownership
	- Community-benefit societies
	- Community land trusts
- Housing
	- Non-for-profit housing cooperatives and developers
	- Active participation, shared ownership of residents into the model
	- Community Land Trusts
	- Redistribution of property and living space - who owns the real estate and can do with less of it (older people, middle+ class), and who needs it
- Money
	- Participatory budgeting, deciding on businesses
	- Social capital: integenerational wealth creation, community capital and real estate
	- Local currencies - how small is too small? how big is too big? liquidity of money
	- Local services, sharing services - a cultural of sharing, not an economy
- Communities and people
	- Not always bounded within the neighbourhood, are we idealising the neighbourhood life?
	- Using existing resources and local expertise & skills
- Participation
	- Active citizenship
	- Constant re-evaluation,  re-regulating neighbourhood
- Energy 
	- Energy communities, reselling produced energy

#### Dramaturgies of change

Variables of change:
- *Setting*: considering the role of the location (mis en scene) for the effect on achieving policy change
- *Time*: the emphasis on 'urgency' jeopardises the importance of allowing for engagement over a longer period of time
- *Narrative*: how do shared stories emerged
- *Soft spaces*: designed interventions outside the sphere of formal politics to help achieve policy change

Using [[backcasting]] as a method to get buy-in to an idea of a desirable future.

Imagination to obtain action
> "The best thing we can invent is a press conference?"

Where do conversations that lead to change take place?
- Hard or soft spaces for politics? #soft-spaces
	- Hard spaces: formal, government, consitutional, town hall, parliament
	- Soft spaces: universities, bi-annual, parc meetings, a non political space turned political
- What is the most appropriate setting to present ideas, to have the most impact?
	- Soft and alternative spaces can give your ideas a better audience

**Imaginaries**
- 'Collectively held, institutionally stabilised, and publicly performed visions of desirable futures'

*Succeeding* (a backcast 'Preview of 2050 - An Energetic Odyssey')
- Need to generate interest (eg. side events) to attract money, pay 'in kind' (knowledge from experts)
- Building a narrative
- While staging the experiment, build a *coalition*
	- Who will carry your message?
	- Stage the industry to make your claims
	- Bring people into the discussion; #transdisciplinary research allows stakeholders to realise who/how many people are involved 
- => soft spaces outside the norm can speed up policy change
- Who won't profit/be excluded from the vision of the future, and is it fair that they are excluded? Can they be included?

*Conclusions*
- Settings crucially influence what can be said with influence
- Soft spaces are curcial to negotaiting futures across spatial boundaries
- Allow for settings where failure is tolerated
- Experiential futureing adds to a new idea for public participation
- Extended engagement is needed to build discourse coalitions
