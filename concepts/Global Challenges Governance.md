[Global Challenges Governance competition winner](https://globalchallenges.org/library-entries/a-truly-global-partnership-helping-the-un-to-do-itself-out-of-a-job/)

Who is excluded from [[governance]] and [[decision making]]?
- NGOs and businesses cannot take part in international organisations, at least on the same level as countries, because these orgs are still very state-centric (eg. UN, taking part in addressing SDGs, Paris Agreement)
- People under 30, even though they make up half the world's population

2 deficits:
- Democracy deficit (ref. above)
- Development deficit: UN and large (state) organisations are ineffective in providing meaningful development work; this work should be awarded to non-state organisations who compete for contracts

State-led programs
- Often inefficient (eg. 'Scared Straight' program to scare kids into not committing crimes to go to prison)
- Rarely defunded, rather, evaluation and coordination boards are appointed to figure out how to make it more efficient
