Melevolant individuals, like dictators, strongly exhibit three traits. They are:
- [[Narcissistic]]
- [[Psychopathic]]
- [[Sadistic]]

It should be a priority to select leaders and people in position of power (politicians, CEOs...) who exhibit non of these trait strongly (ie. they would be [[benevolant]]). This would require ''manipulation proof measures of malevolance'' [1].

These traits are formulated into the Dark Tetrad (or Dark Triad for the first three): [[Machiavellianism]], narcissicm, psychopathy and sadism.
