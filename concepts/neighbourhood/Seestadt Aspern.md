### well-designed public space
#public-space 

"The basic principle and starting point here is a *dense network of public streets and squares* in which the arrangement of buildings and open spaces reflects the *human scale*.

The design of public spaces is primarly geared to people moving at walking pace and aims to provide a setting that is *pleasant* to linger in. This calls for *interdisciplinary planning* right from the very outset.

Streets, squares and parks should be designed to facilitate *appropriation*, for *flexibility of use*, and to provide *options for further development*."
