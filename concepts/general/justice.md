Different forms of justice:
- distributive
- procedural
- recognition-based 

### distributional justice


### epistemic justice



### hermeneutical justice

Hermeneutical injustice occurs when a group of people doesn't know how to express their experience, because their experience doesn't fit any concepts known to them (or others), because of a historic exclusion of this group in activities which shape the language people have to express their experiences.
