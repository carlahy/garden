#### Assignment
Choose an article in the popular media that quotes a published quantitative research article and includes a link or specifics about the original article.
Read media article and original research article.
- Evaluate how well the media presented results of study
- Evaluate validity of original study (appropriateness of design methods...)


Quantitative measurements
- Theoretically, we want to know the underlying unobservable concept
- Empirically, we measure the observable
- Quantitative data is not objective!


*Ted talk - Mona Chalabi, 3 ways to spot a bad statistic*
1. Can you see uncertainty?
	- hard to collect accurate data
	- over-stated certainty, charting/graphing projects objective science which it isn't; hand drawn visualisation makes it human and shows there may be inaccuracies
2. Can I see myself in the data?
3. How is data collected?

Data collection
- National census: influenced by funding, sampling strategies, 
- There's always people missing from the data

*Quantitative research questions*
- What do we need to measure?
- How to test the data? Against predictions/hypotheses:
	- Null hypothesis (predict no different or no relationship, H0)
	- Nondirectional hypothesis (predict a relationship but not its direction, H1)
	- Directional hypothesis (predict both a relationship and its direction, H1)


Eg. *Barcelona's [[superblocks|(super)blocks]]*
- Air pollutants higher where vulnerable/marginalised populations live (in Eixample) #environmental-justice
- RQ: Do superblocks reduce air pollution?
	- Ho: superblocks have no effect on air pollution
	- H1: areas with superblocks and without superblocks have different levels of air pollution (non-directional)
	- H1: areas with superblocks have significantly less air pollution than areas without superblocks (directional) => what we hope to find
	- What groups do we need to compare? areas with superblocks, and areas with no superblocks
- RQ (more complicated): do variations in superblock designs or locations have implications for air pollution?
	- Ho: superblocks have no effect on air pollution
	- H1: different types of superblocks have different impacts on air pollution
	- H2: superblocks in areas with greater car traffic reduce air pollution more than superblocks in areas with less car traffic
	- Groups: superblocks with different typologies/interventions, include a non-superblock area as a benchmark
- What do we need to measure to answer our RQ?
	- *Exposure*:
	- *Mediator*: explains relationship between exposure and outcome; eg. car traffic
	- *Moderator*: changes the relationship between exposure and outcome; internal or external characteristics of area; eg. qualities and typologies of the superblock (greenery), socio-economic variables (eg. race, age)
	- *Outcome*: eg. air pollution


#### Green space and gentrification
- [[environmental justice]]: poor and minority residents suffer more from environmental toxics, unsafe working conditions, or climate risks (Pellow and Brulle 2005, Mohai and Saha 2015)  
- Green gentrification
- Gentrification and health theory - gentrification causes:
	- stress -> bad for health
	- loss of social networks, feelings of social isolation and disconnection -> bad for health
	- displacement -> stressful and bad for health
- Gentrification as a moderator between green spaces and health
	- RQ: do all residents benefit from living near active green space? Does gentrification modify the relationship between expore to green space and health outcomes?
		- H0: gentrification doesn't have an impact between green space and health
		- H1: gentrification has an impact on the relation of green space and health (?)
		- H2: gentrification negatively impacts the health of marginalised populations living near green space (?)
		- Groups: those living near green space; those not living near green space; compare social groups among those living in same areas (newly arrived, long-term residents)
	- Data sources
		- Individual data
			- Self-related general health
			- Demographic data
		- Neigbhourhood data
			- Active green space: zip code + 400 meter buffer considered as active green space
			- Gentrification: college education, professional occupation, non-hispanic white, residents of colour, income levels
			- Neighbourhood control variables
		- Data was linked by zip code (present in health and demographic data sets), ie. over statistical unit

#### quantitative measurements
- How do we measure...
	- age, blood pressure, gender, air pollution, poverty (feelings of poverty, being under the poverty line, income relative to those around), gentrification (measurement over time), GDP, green space, exposure to green space
- Types of measurements
	- Discrete variables: values separate from each other
	- Continuous variables: values relate to each other
- *Nominal*
	- categorical variables, 2+ categories and no natural order
	- eg. languages: categories but no ordering possible
- *Binary dichotomous*
	- categorical variables with exactly 2 possibilities
	- eg. yes/no
- *Ordinal*
	- categorical variables with rank order in value
	- distance between each category is not standardised or measurable
	- eg. health ratings (poor vs. great)
	- *Scale*
		- continuous measure and not categorical
		- interval: continuous variable where the difference between two values is meaningful, no genuine '0' point
			- eg. temperature, can be negative
		- ratio: has a true '0', indicating there is none
			- eg. age (can't have 0/no/negative age)

Measuring *active* green spaces:
- From all public owned park properties: waterfront walkways, public recreation fields, parks, accessible preservers where people can hike, community gardens
Measuring *gentrification*
- Variable scored and indexed, and considered an indicator if greater than (or less than) the average increase of city as a whole over the same time period (2000-2010)
- 3 categories: gentrifying, non-gentrifying, non-gentrifiable (already wealthy)

#### Sampling
- Sample: what is observable and measurable, and is meant to represent the entire population in order to make inferences on the population
- Diversity in samples & representation
	- eg. cities: growing/shrinking, specific trajectories (post-industrial), geographic location (coastal)

#### unit of analysis
- Smallest unit of comparison in a study
- What is being compared
- Datasets organised and linked to one another by the unit of analysis
- eg. people, neighbourhoods, cities, zip codes

*Quantitatively* measuring *abstract* concepts in social science research
- How to measure social cohesion, collective efficacy, discrimination, religiosity, economic indicators?
- Results from samples are generalised to the population - how broad is the population/how widely can we generalise?
	- eg. to cities everywhere, in the same country, region, or to no cities?

#### validity
- *Internal validity*: to what extent are results due to independent/exposure variable, and not some outside reason?
	- Criterion validity: does the test accurately predit what it is supposed to predict
	- Construct validity: how well does the test generalise to the concept it's supposed to measure
	- Content validity: extent to which a measure represents all facets of a given construct
	- Threats to internal validity
		- Instrumentation differences: 
		- Selection of subjects: biases resulting from the selection of subjects
		- Social desirability bias: when someone knows they're being tested
- *External validity*: generalisability of results
	- Threats to external validity
		- Interaction between selection biases and experimental variable: exposure causes a different effect in the study than in real world (eg. superblocks: doing really detailed measurements that can't be done across entire city; thus results you're seeing are because of the details you studied something, but the real world could never do this)
		- Reactive effects of experimental arrangements: participants know they are participating in a study

#### reliability
- Degree to which assessment produces stable and consistent results
- Will you get the same results if you repeat the same measurements?
- Threats to reliability: researcher or observer error, environmental changes, participant changes
