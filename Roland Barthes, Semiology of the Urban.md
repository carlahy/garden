#### *Semiology of the Urban*, Roland Barthes
- [[Roland Barthes]] was a french philosopher, theorist, [[semiotics|semiotician]] 
- *Semiology and the Urban*
	- A text about the importance of semiology (the study of signs) in the city
	- Qs: Signified and signifiers; Does [[signification]] mean the same thing as meaning?; Signifying spaces
	- Introduces Kevin Lynch's way of interpreting a city, "in the same terms as the consciousness perceiving it" (p. 159). Lynch has semantic defintion of the urban based on discrete units (axes, nodes, edges, landmarks...)
	- There is a conflict between the **rational** (scientific and calculated planning, utilitarian purposes, functional necessity reason) and **signification** (meaning assigned, subjectivity, 'semantic charge'). A city cannot be built on reason alone, there is another force out of the control of science and reason which shapes it. "it is growing daily more evident that a city is a tissue formed not of equal elements whose functions we can enumerate, but of strong and neutral elements, or ... of marked and unmarked elements" (p. 160)
	- An example of the conflict between signification and reality: geographically, two neighbourhoods may be adjoining and share a physical border, thus be in proximity to one another; however in people's interpretations and imaginaries, these neighbourhoods are distinct and unrelated. 
	- Barthes says that the "language of the city" must move from the metophorical (eg. "language of flowers") to the real, for which we need the technique of **symbols**
	- **Symbolism, signified and signifiers**
	- The city center is an empty focal point

- *The Eiffel Tower*
	- Speaks about the omnipresence of the Tower, which is seen from every angle in Paris but also *sees* everything. Barthes gives human-like qualities and senses to the Tower, "touch", "sees", is seen. Later, he also gives super-human or god-like qualities to the Tower (p. 170), it is "neither brain nor organ... the Tower is merely the witness, the gaze which discreetly fixes, with its slender signal, the whole structure - geographical, historical, and social - of Paris space" (p. 170)
	- The Tower is also a *symbol*, "belongs to the universal language of travel". Everyone knows about the tower, it lives in our imaginations, its a "symbol of Paris, of modernity, of communication, of science or of the 19th century".
	- As a symbol, it is powerful. It is not purely **functional** (which was one of its critiques before/when/after it was built), and it does not have any material use. But, it has power through its symbolism. The meaning we (society) attaches to it changes, "who can say what the Tower will  be for humanity tomorrow?" (p. 166). The Tower then aquires a mythical quality ("the overwhelming muth of the Tower" (p. 166)). Having no use is rarely 'allowed', as all planned urban structures are meant to have a purpose
	- Talks about the concept of **panorama**, which is "an image we attempt to decipher, in which we try to recognise known sites, to identify landmarks". The Tower offers a panorama (with itself at the center). When looking at a panorama, you see what yourself know, and "decipher" what you are looking at such that you "find signs within it" (p. 168)
	- Gives distinct "functions of human life" starting from the level of the Eiffel tower, down to the ground level, functions ranging from "pleasure" of Montmartre to business at the center, and finally study, spreading into residential, green space, and blue-collar work (p. 170)
	- The way he speaks of the Tower as an omnipresent figure seeing all and being seen by all reminds me of a type of surveillance state mechanism, 1984, dystopian Brave New World. Is this what he hints at, when he says "*the Tower ultimately reunites with the essential function of all major human sites: [[autarchy]]*" (p. 172) ?
