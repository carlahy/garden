### notes

- [[mental mapping]]: doesn't assume any knowledge or expression of a space, and let's the individual express themselves more freely 
  *"Compared to participatory spatial methods/tools like participatory Geographical Information System (PPGIS; see Rall et al. 2017, on cultural ES in Berlin), which support sharing personal experiences and information (using predefined topical quantities and qualities) into a web-based geographical map, **mental mapping does not require any predefined categories or classes and exclusively relies on how a person reproduces knowledge about a place and on the drawing capability of this person** (Matei et al. 2001). Consequently, it is an excellent tool for assessing tacit knowledge of respondents in terms of a specific spatial entity."* 
  A way to combat [[justice#hermeneutical justice|hermeneutical injustice]]?
