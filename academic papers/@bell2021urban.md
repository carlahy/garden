#### chapter 3: co-design with local stakeholders

- Co-design
	- how to integrate multiple (local) perspectives into the designing process, discusses different ways to engage them
	- Who are the stakeholders for UBS: citizens, representatives of groups/organisations, local residents, landowners, local government and council representatives, investors and local entrepreneurs
	- A **participatory approach** includes experts and general public. It should  include those who don't often have a voice (eg. marginalised groups or individuals)
	- Can be complicated
		- Social complexity: *"the personal characteristics of stakeholders and their relationships, as well as social style and differences of culture and knowledge, can limit effective collaboration"* (p. 60)
- Case study Kopliranna, Tallinn, Estonia
	- Kopli peninsula has been a marginal and socially challenged area since the 1990s, today experiencing densification and gentrification due to demand for housing
	- An blue-green space on the sea, surrounded with industrial and harbour activities which make the recreational area scarce
	- **Koplirand**
	- **Purpose of intervention** is to attract people to visit the space, and increase the use of the coast in an industrial and harbour area in North Tallinn
	- Users and non-users from the local community were involved at multiple stages of the design process. First, they were interviewed in to understand their perceptions, use and problems with Koplirand. They also participated in workshops on the design of the intervention, suggesting locations and types of interventions. Finally, design proposals were presented in local public spaces and people could vote on their prefered design.   
	  Ultimately, this collaboration allowed the researchers to create a design which would best respond to the concerns expressed by locals. As a result, XX
  - Reflections
	  - Challenge to involve those who aren't using the space,and understand why *"Even more important was to meet the people who never visit the case study area or any public space near the sea in order to know why people might not visit the area."* (p. 84)
	  - This could be mitigated by going to public places (eg. shopping malls) and talking to a different crowd
  - Result
	  - An absolute increase in users specifically at the spots where the interventions took place  *"The preliminary assessment of the before-and-after site observations (Figure 3.17) shows an absolute increase in users and then a distinct focus of use associated with the interventions (shown as red shapes on the second heat map)."*
