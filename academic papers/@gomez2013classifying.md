tldr; classifies urban ecosystem services and disservices; "examines how different values of ES provided in urban areas may be captured and measured, and how they can be used to inform urban planning"; synthesises concepts, methods and tools to classifiy and value urban ES;


- The urban society is "increasingly decoupled from ecosystems"
- This paper **synthesises the knowledge and methods that are used to classify and value ecosystem services** for urban planning
- Cities are dependent on ecosystems to provide "long-term conditions for life, health, security, good social relations, and other important aspects of human well-being"
- Services categorised into economic and non-economic values
- Different habitats provide different ecosystem services specific to that habitat
- Urban ecosystem services
	- URBAN ES particularly important in services with direct impact on health and security like air purification, noise reduction, urban cooling, runoff mitigation
	- Classifying urban ES
		- Food supply 
		- Waterflow regulation and runoff mitigation: increasing the impermeable surface area reduces the capacity of water to be absorbed in the soil and by vegetation, thus increasing vulnerability to floods
		- Urban temperature regulation: counters heat island effects
			- **UBS** in tandem with green, regulate local temperatures, absorbs heat in summer and releases it in winter - **regulating ES**
		- Waste treatment: **ponds** filter waste and reduce pollution in urban waste waters; **streams** retain and fix nutrients from organic waste - **supporting ES**
		- Recreation and cognitive development
	- Disservices: functions of an ecosystem that are negative for human well-being; eg. allergies from plants, diseases transmitted by animals, chemicals emitted by plants, views blocked by trees
	- Set of values extracted from ES: 
		- Economic values: a decrease in urban ecosystem services often leads to an economic loss, because human intervention is required in order to deliver or to mitigate the adverse effects due to the missing service. For example, reduced green cover leads to higher energy costs for cooling in the summer; need to consider the **economic costs from disservices**
		- Social and cultural values: "people hold moral, spiritual, educational, aesthetic, place-based and other values towards the urban environment, all of which can afect their attitudes and actions toward ecosystems and the services they provide"
			- "articulation of social and cultural values into decision-making processes can be particularly challenging in urban areas because of the very high cultural and social heterogeneity" (p. 240)
		- Insurance values
	- Challenges to ES valuation in urban planning
		- "Littl eis known about ethnic minorities preference for urban ecosystems"
