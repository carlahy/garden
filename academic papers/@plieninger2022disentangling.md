### notes
- Definition of [[blue-green infrastructure]]: ''GBI as an umbrella term comprises networks of natural and semi-natural areas, with other environmental features, designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services''
- UBI (urban blue infrastructure) provides [[cultural ecosystem services]] ''such as outdoor recreation, tourism, sense of place, and aesthetic values have received particular attention'' (p. 2)
- This paper focuses on *perceptions* of [[ecosystem services]] provided by UBS
	- *''perceptions define whether and how people recognise the supply of ecosystem services (refs) and play a critical mediating role between the actual supply of services and people's demand and use thereof''*
- From the perspective of [[environmental justice]], it is necessary to take perceptions into account, or otherwise risk excluding relevant actors and designing unfair spaces
	- Perceptions are key in understanding the link between supply and demand/use of UBS
