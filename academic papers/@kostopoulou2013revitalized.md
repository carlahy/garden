### notes relevant for thesis

- historic waterfronts are being redeveloped into *"creative milieus to host creative industries"*. The *creative tourists* visit places not based on heritage but on contemporary culture and liveliness
- 20th century: cities are investing into urban waterfront redevelopment projects to reintegrate abandoned or derelict harbours into the urban fabric
- In post-industrial cities, there is an increasing demand for cultural institutions, and the waterfronts (and city governments) have had to adapt to this demand by reconverting eg. warehouses into attractive lively urban centres, notably centres of tourism
- City branding waterfronts: mixed use of working, living, shopping, recreation. A well-documented phenomenon
- Nordhavn: an **elite** space hidden behind ideals of public space like open, free harbour baths supporting virbant urban life
	- "*economic-oriented exploitation of the port areas can lead, at an extreme case, to the creation of "non places", like leisure parks, commercial and entertainment complexes. At the other extreme, a "mono-thematic" culture dependent approach to waterfront development, can lead to the creation of social "elite" cultural areas*"
- Habitus?
- *"having been cosmopolitan, multi-cultural and multi-ethnic places, leading gateways for the exchange of goods and ideas, port-areas bear witness to specific multiple forms of human interaction, of business and oscial meeting, of exchange and communication, a unique blend of tangible and intangible cultural heritage traditions related with water. "* (p. 4586)
