- Some papers discuss the *characteristics* of ES, rather than the *benefits* derived from the ES
- Research reviews 850 publications on ES of GBI (green blue infra), and focus on 6 ES (note that provisioning ES are not represented):
	- local temperature regulation (regulating ES)
	- stormwater regulation (regulating ES)
	- waste treatment (water purification and soil remediation) (regulating ES)
	- air quality regulation (regulating ES)
	- pollination (supporting ES)
	- recreation (cultural ES)
	- aesthetic appreciation (cultural ES)

- To assess the publications, they extracted all indicators ("variables or proxies used to quantify the ES") and characterised them into ecosystem indicator, demand indicator, service indicator and recognition indicator
	- Ecosystem indicators: a property of the ecosystem, eg. capacity or potential to deliver a service, based on properties of the ecosystem 
	- Demand indicators: "the number of people wanting to experience the ES", the preferences for a specific attribute of an ES (eg. biophysical characteristic, location) 
	- Service indicators: the contribution of an ES to people's needs, or demands
	- Recognition indicators: the value that people report attaching to an ES
- Most of the publications focused on 'unspecified GBI', followed by parks and semi-natural green space, followed by green and blue structures connected to grey structures (17%), water areas (10%) and building greens (8%)
- Finding that blue infrastructure is underrepresented in the literature on ES
