### notes

- dynamics like heavy rainfall, dry spells, urbanisation, scarce public green space, influence how cities deal with water challenges like flooding, water scarcity, pollution, rainwater management, drainage, etc. (p. 1)
- *"[[blue-green infrastructure]] is defined as an interconnected network of landscape components, both natural and designed, that includes open, green spaces and water bodies"*  (p. 2)
	- different from [[nature-based solutions]] in that BGI is designed to deal with water during events like excessive rainfall or flooding
- Emphasis on *"[[multifunctionality]] and the provision of multiple [[co-benefits]] as fundamental to the growing appeal of BGI"* (p. 2) 
- *"BGI can reduce the impacts of [[climate change]] by [[climate mitigation|mitigating]] risks associated with extreme storms, droughts and heatwaves; improve water security, air and water quality; enhance wildlife and [[biodiversity]]; increase urban greenspace and landscape connectivity; improve physical and mental [[health and well-being]]; create attractive landscapes and positive [[place making]]; support sustainable water resource management, and lenghten the service provision of ageing grey infrastructure currenly operating beyond its design life"* (p. 2)


### thoughts
- this paper is about the [[regulating ecosystem services]]
