### notes
- [[ecosystem services]] (ES) are all the benefits offered by ecosystems like urban nature
- Value from ecosystem services comes from the relationship and responsibilities that people have towards nature
- **[[cultural ecosystem services]]** (CES) are the *'intangible, human benefits derived from urban green space'*, like the sense of place, recreation, inspiration, opportunities for education, spiritual enrichment (p. 1)
- **perceptions of ecosystem value**: value is based not only on the physical space, but of the personal characteristics of the people who use them (age, gender, income...) and their social context (cultural background, social networks...)
	- How do people in a specific physical and socio-economic context come to value the ecosystem services provided by UGS? DIfferent frameworks, eg. cascade
- How people come to view the value of CES: *interactions with nature --> perceived benefits of nature --> perceived value from ecosystem services*
- Supply and demand of urban nature
	- Supply is the *"availability of opportunities for cultural practices within environmental spaces"* , the "location and quality of individual environmental spaces"
	- Demand is: *"the needs, desires and intentions of people to exploit these opportunities"*, the "preferences, values and practices of local populations"

- Data analysis:
	- **Socio-demographic variations** in use and valuation
	- Identifying **mismatches** in UGS provision: mismatch between what people think is important to them, and there interpretation of the space (eg. personal safety is important but most frequented place feels unsafe)


### results
- Two distinct groups identified: those who like nature, and those who like social aspects; they have varying:
	- **Motivations** for use of UGS, and valuation of UGS characteristics
	- **Mismatches** in UGS characteristics, in accessibility
