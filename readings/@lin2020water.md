- On [[regulating ecosystem services]], how UBS can alleviate [[climate change|extreme climate events]]

### notes
- tldr; green spaces are renowned nature-based strategies to combat heat stress in cities, but the potential of blue spaces hasn't been as widely researched and utilised; the objective is to demonstrate and measure the extent to which blue spaces can [[climate mitigation|mitigate]] surface urban heat islands, by studying [[Pearl River Delta|Shenzen-Hong Kong]] agglomeration
	- conclusion is that morphology and density of [[blue space]] changes the impact of BS on mitigating SUHI (large bodies like oceans, lakes, reservoirs have greater impact); green islands help mitigate inland UHI 
- [[urban heat island]] (UHI) is *"the most conspicuous and widely perceived impact of urban climate change caused by human activities"* (p. 1)
	- three types of urban heat islands: surface UHI, boundary layer HI, canopy layer HI
- blue and green spaces have ecosystems that naturally alleviate climate change impacts on cities, and are considered [[nature-based solutions]] 
- blue spaces have lower surface temperatures than green spaces, but they are more difficult to provide and maintain in cities, therefore, their potential has been less explored and water-based solutions less put into practice by [[urban planning|urban planners]] (p. 2, p. 6), even when there are abundant blue spaces in the city.
- blue spaces have **evaporative effects and high heat capacity**, and can serve as **urban heat storages**, which can help combat excessively hot temperatures
- the morphology of blue spaces change their efficacity wrt heat mitigation (eg. geometry, size...)
- findings
	- blue spaces have **cooling effects** that drive SUHI (surface urban heat islands) temperatures down
	- **spillover effect** means that cooling effect extends to 200m
	- coastal blue spaces work to cool coastal areas, and **inland green** cooling islands/channels help cool continuous hot areas/heat islands $\rightarrow$ ==blue and green spaces working together==
	- **larger bodies** of water (eg. ocean, lakes, reservoirs) have a greater impact on SUHI mitigation (than eg. rivers) because they have a greater **evaporative cooling capacity** (evaporation is how cooling works) --> **compact shape** of green/blue space has greater effect on temperature than long and irregular shapes
	- **density** of water bodies is associated with SUHI mitigation
