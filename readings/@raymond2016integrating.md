- Uses PPGIS (Public Participation Geographic Information System) method for *"spatially identifying and assessing multiple elements of environmental justice in urban blue space"* Using Finland as a case study, it looks for:
	- *"Diversity and spatial distribution of clusters base don the activities undertaken in urban blue space"*. A cluster is an area defined by the type of activity carried out there
	- *"Diversity of users in each cluster, representing a composite measure of income, age and family income"*, also race, gendre, disabilities. How facilities and services influence who uses the space
	- *"Extent of perceived problems and unpleasant experiences in each cluster"
- [[environmental justice]]: a principle that claims that all people have a right to be protected from environmental pollution, and live in a clean and healthy environment.
	- PPGIS enables urban planning to tailor blue spaces to specific types of activities and users. It is used within the context of environmental justice, because it helps analyse user diversity (the mix of users) and perceived problems and unpleasant experience (PPUE, the perceived negative qualities of a place). PPGIS can help analyse how *"different elements of environmental justice are spatially distributed across the landscape. Understanding environmental justice from multiple perspectives is crucial to ensuring that urban settings are designed in ways that contribute to a range of place-based experiences, including social interactions between diverse user groups, as well as provide possibilities for connection to nature."* (p. 199)
	- Environmental justice resonates with SDG 11 to *"provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces"*
	- Privatisation of urban space is taking away opportunities for people to connect with each other, and with nature
	- **Multiplicity as a principle in urban inclusion** may create conflict between different user types and PPUE, based for example on the types of activities offered, and can lead to feelings of exclusion, discomfort or fear #inclusive-public-space #right-to-city #right-to-blue-space

- Helsinki and surrounding regions as case study: the context is that Helsinki residents are never more than 10km away from the shore
	- Survey asked participants about PPUE (encompasses cost, inclusivity, facilities, environment, safety...), usage based on time of year, activity, socio-demographic features (age, income, ethnicity, family situation...)
	- Income level was a strong determinator of accessibility

- Environmental justice is multidimensional: the paper takes into account user diversity, activity diversity, and PPUE
	- Using four-quadrant framework for combining user diversity and activity diversity (high/low user diversity, high/low activity diversity matrix), they classify areas ("clusters"), for eg. Helsinki shorelines are mostly hi user/lo activity diversity, and lo user/hi activity diversity
	- By classifying areas into these quarters, they could see what type of blue space existed (in terms of users and activities), and find some characteristics of the quarters (eg. more nature activities in one area, maybe because of the environment?)

- Most cited PPUE was *"certain group of people or use method bothers me"*, *"the environment is littered or not cared for"*, *"the water quality is poor"*, *"the location is crowded"*

- $\Rightarrow$ This paper focuses on environmental justice which I think is a great term to help frame my research interest, because it incorporates principles like sustainability, inclusivity, and right to open blue spaces. The paper looks at the diversity of users, diversity of activities, and the PPUE (perceived problems and unpleasant experience) of the blue spaces, to demonstrate the multidimensionality of environmental justice. It also made me wonder whether I should focus on a certain socio-demographic group (by age, income levels, gender, ethnicity, etc.), and  how that group is affected by the presence, uses, and/or design of blue spaces, or lack thereof
