- Access to *"attractive, safe and inclusive blue spaces"* heightens people's psychological wellbeing, and especially that of those living in *==deprived urban areas==
- The first study to evaluate the impact of small scale interventions (where the built environment was altered) in a deprived urban area, on the psychological wellbeing of the residents/users. The well being of the residents and visitors was assessed (by self reporting) before and after the intervention. Community was involved in the project
	- BlueHealth did *"urban blue acupuncture"* interventions, to evaluate the extent to which small scale/modest intervention can positively impact mental health
	- Hypothesis was three fold (p. 3), importance of site quality, feelings of personal safety, and community belonging
	- The renovation included: a theatre with seating facing the water, removing parking on the access path, renovating the "slipway" (access path), improving the playground (p. 3, 2.1)
	- They emphasise the importance of involving the residents in the renovation, and acknowledge that doing so makes it hard to understand whether the increase in wellbeing is due to the renovated infrastructure, or the experience of being involved in a community project
- Result was a greater sense of wellbeing due to a feeling of community belonging; and a greater sense of life satisfaction due to "greater satisfaction with personal safety and community belonging"

- Challenges in upscaling/upgrading green and blue spaces
	- Are people who live near green and blue spaces healthier and happier because of their proximity to the spaces, or is it that people with greater health and happiness happen to live near green and blue spaces because they can afford to and choose to?
	- Do the interventions lead to gentrification, causing wealthier and healthier populations to move in?
	- $\rightarrow$ this study calls for more research in areas where the population is stable: eg. areas with a large number of social housing which will stay social and where wealthier populations will not move in
- Potential benefits of blue spaces in deprived areas
	- Populations in deprived areas/low socio-economic status have poorer mental and physical health, and 
	- Visits to coastal blue spaces is more equitable across socio-economic groups, compared to woodland (p. 2, 1.1)

- Potential mechanisms
	- Better environment quality leads to better health benefits; in particular, (good) facilities, improved access to riverbank, presence of wildlife. Eg. riverbank in Barcelona
	- Blue space renovation leads to increased feelings of safety, which in turn positively influences mental health; qualitative investigation on blue spaces shows that feelings of safety greatly increases the use of blue spaces (p. 3, 1.2) 
	- Community belonging, a sense of community and social cohesion "mediate" relation between green space and mental wellbeing
