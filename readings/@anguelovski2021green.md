### notes 

- [[environmental justice]]
- governments promoting [[tricke down effects]] of greening, when in reality it causes gentrification and leaves the most vulnerable even worse off *"Often underpinned by a list of ecological, health, social and economic benefts, when residents listen to public offcials, planners, investors and even health and ecology experts, there are told that greening is a win-win strategy. No one is left behind by the trickle-down of benefts from green infrastructure. Green increases value, helps you connect with your neighbors, encourages physi- cal activity and recreation and fulflls climate goals. Itâ€™s a 100% fail-proof pack- age, a drumbeat that seems to have cities across the globe marching in unison."* (p. 4)
- greening requires *"bold, progressive social policies"* (p. 4) in order to combat these ills
- *"achieving equity requires questioning the social exclusion and white privilege embedded in new greening landscapes and how those social dynamics reshape security and vulnerability"* (p. 4)
- definition of green interventions: *"small- or large-scale nature-based infrastructure and amenities such as parks, municipal or community gardens, greenbelts and greenways, raingardens and bioswales, green roofs and walls, green streets and alleys or restored waterways"*
- the green [[rent gap]]
- *"Park and Pellow defined [[environmental privilege]] as the disproportionate access and beneft harnessed by white, upper-class residents in regard to green and open spaces, waterfronts and coastlines, fresh food, healthy housing and recreational facilities (Park and Pellow 2011)"* (p. 7)

- in post-industrial context European cities, including Amsterdam, used waterfront redevelopments as an [[urban renewal]] strategy
