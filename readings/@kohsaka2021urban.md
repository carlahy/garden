### notes 
- [[covid 19]] pandemic and strict lockdowns have made people more aware of the importance of blue and green spaces in the city, thereby reshaping urban-rural relationships; changes in the way city residents interact with rural spaces for living, playing and working ("workation" as work in vacation places)
- re-discovered [[commons]] 
- Analysing the uses of public parks in the US show that visits to parks differ based on income, gender and age: higher income families, women, and younger people visit more frequently; but no determined theory as to why
- *"[[blue carbon]] ecosystems can contribute to a global mitigation approach for climate change"* (p. 3)
