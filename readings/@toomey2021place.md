### notes
- Explores people's perception of blue spaces, how people have a sense of space associated to blue spaces particularly in degraded spaces or those located in marginalised communities. Revitalisation projects risk disturbing

#### revitalisation of waterfronts
- New developments and new kind of public demand have put the focus of urban planning on sustainability, revitalisation and resilience
- Urban planning projects to revitalise, rehabilitate, reconnect urban water and waterfronts- includes *"pollution mitigation, coastal restoration, climage change adaptation, rezoning, economic development, and increased public access to waterfront areas"* (p. 2)
- How do waterfront revitalisation projects support or disrupt the sense of place related to the water? Are some types of connections/relationships to the waterfront being privileged over others?

#### place making, place disruption, place protection
- Three concepts around which they articulate typesof engagement and meanings that people/communities attach to a place

#### methods
- Triangulation of three methods
	- "We collected data on how people use, make meaning of, and engage"
	- 1. *"Social assessments are designed to gather information on a specified geographic area through quantitative counts of human activity and signs of human use, coded interview data tagged to specific locations, and qualitative field notes capturing participant observations"*; observations, rapid interviews with waterfront users
	- 2. In-depth qualitative interviews with knowledgeable/expert interviews
	- 3. media discourse

--> observations, rapid interviews with waterfront users, and semi-structured interviews with "experts"

#### findings
- *"demonstrate a wide range of uses and perceptions as well as deep place attachments held by local users with regard to CIC [the case study], which give insight into understanding how the meanings associated with the waterfront have changed over time"* (p. 8)
- promoting language like "place-disruption" and "place-protection" can help marginalised communities articulate their feelings and relationship to a waterfront (referring to [[justice#hermeneutical justice|hermeneutical justice]])
- It is assumed that places degraded by pollution or industry hold no values for the local communities

### thesis relevance
- What about "social assessment methods" mixed with short interviews?
