- Summarises the quantitative evidence from existing research on the positive effects of blue spaces on people's health, and concludes that there is a correlation between blue space exposure and benefits in mental health and in wellbeing. Says there is too few and too much heterogeneity in the studies
- There are claims of the positive effect of blue space on people's health and wellbeing, either by being \textbf{proximally or distally/virtually} (being in, on or near/being able to see, hear or sense water). The effects of blue spaces could be similar to that of green spaces, which include *"stress reduction, increased physical activity, promotion of positive social contacts, increased place attachment and the reduction of extreme temperatures"* (p. 1212)
- Differentiates outdoor blue space type into inland (rivers, lakes, ponds, streams, rivulets, wetlands, freshwaters) and non-inland (coast, beach, salt waters)

$\Rightarrow$ This paper reviews quantitative studies on blue space and associated health benefits. It reports the type of blue space, the environment of the blue space, and how the health outcomes were evaluated.

What I found useful was the differentiation between inland and non-inland spaces, which I will use in my research. I also realised I don't want to focus specifically on the relation of blue space to human health (eg. general health, mental health and wellbeing, physical activity, other morbidities) because there is already good research in this area, especially in Europe. I still want to focus on the social aspect of blue spaces, but perhaps more on blue spaces as open, public and free spaces. Also, quantitative research will be hard because I don't think I would be able to reach enough participants (I assume in the scale of hundreds?) in both case studies
