## Notes

- Looks at three things:
	- *"Practices and materials of everyday life, illustrated by food and energy movements"*
	- *"Ongoing work on community and the importance of identity and attachment, informed by urban planning, food, and climate concerns"*
	- *"Growing interest in the relationship between human practices and communities and nonhuman nature"*
	- *"As our environment is increasingly disrupted by a highly neoliberal and capitalized world marked by increasing inequality and vulnerability, we ask how EJ scholarship can be rearticulated and used to challenge, respond to, and rework the rapidly changing environmental, economic, social and political context of our communities"*Â  (p. 330)

- [[environmental justice]] and [[climate justice]] are relevant topics to all levels of society (individual to global): in COP 2015 in Paris, agreement that climate change was a collective responsibility, and the developing nations/most vulnerable should be financially and technically supported by wealthier nations; *"equity is a key principle throughout, and the importance of climate justice is explicitly noted"* (p. 323)

- History of EJ
	- Minority communities like Black, indigenous hispanic, had to become experts in environmental matters like toxic waste, in order to demand safe living conditions and thus have spearheaded the environmental justice movement (EJM)

- Environmental Justice Paradigm (EJP) 
	- Is *"the first environmental discourse constructed by people of color and is "framed around concepts like autonomy, self-determination, access to resources, fairness and justice, and civil and human rights" "* (p. 325)
	- First environmental discourse to be linked race, gender, class, social injustice, and not the mainstream white/wealthy/male environmental discourse
	- A sustainable society isn't one where only environmental/green concerns are addressed. *"A truly sustainable society is one where wider questions of social needs and welfare, and economic opportunity are integrally related to environmental limits imposed by supporting ecosystems"* (p. 326)

- Methodologies
	- Spatial analytical method: for substantiating claims that toxic waste affect disproportionately low-income people and people of colour, they compared demographic census data with and without waste facilities
	- [[GIS]]
	- Shift from quantitative to qualitative and interdisciplinary approach (mid-1990s), which expanded EJ to more methodologies, social theories, epistemologies, frameworks from social, economic, historical disciplines (p. 327)

- Expansion of concept of EJ: as the term gained popularity and became inter-disciplinary, it was expanded by some to consider wider aspects of justice (ref [[@toomey2021place]]! )
	- ==Three conceptions of [[justice]]: distributive, procedural, recognition-based== (Walker)
		-  *"expand beyond the unequal distributions of impacts and/or responsibilities to include the processes of disrespect, devaluation, degradation, or insult of some people versus others; inclusion or exclusion in participation and procedure; and the provision and protection of the basic capabilities or needs of everyday life"* (in quote)

- Inextricable connection of individual and community identity to place, means that stigmatisation and degradation of places is obligatorily linked to people
- Globalisation
	- One case of sustainability may be considered just locally, but not outside of the local context if the burden was shifted to another location nationally or internationally, and thus created a new injustice (p. 328) $\rightarrow$ **wealthy nations outsource externalities to developing nations**

- Practice and Materiality
	- How everyday practices are increasingly part of environmental justice
	- Food injustice looks at inequities along the food supply chain, at local/national/global scales, and how they overlap with EJ themes like toxics, health, indigenous justice, climate justice $\rightarrow$ food access, food security, food sovereignty
	- Politics of sustainability of everyday life: replacing unsustainable practices and production with local, sustainable, conscious alternatives
	- *"Things, stuff, and our material lives have power and are invariably connected to the way that environmental injustice is produced, experienced, reproduced and resisted"* (p. 332)

- Community, identity, attachment
	- *Where* is environmental justice?
	- Public spaces are places of community, identity and attachment, and all should have equal rights to them (eg. parks, streets). Streets are public places and everyone in the community should have equal rights and access to them, except that cars have more access, and thus people with cars have more rights to the streets - which is often not low-income communities, who do not own a car but use public transit
	- The inter-cultural city is a place that is designed and developed by everyone, where everyone has something to contribute and it is a joint endeavour (p. 333) (ref. [[@van2021urban]] who talks engaging the local community in a revitalisation project)
	- Sharing: moving beyond the shared economy, towards understanding cities in their entirety as shared spaces, and acting sharing them fairly; sharing economy should not ignore equity and justice
	- Urban renewal causes displacement and gentrification; health food movements causes gentrification and ==environmental privilege== $\rightarrow$ ecological, green, environmental gentrification
	- If people are attached to a particular environment, and that attachment is disrupted, then individual and collective well-being is damaged; people lose their sense of self as actors and do-ers in the places they inhabit


## Thesis relevance
- Think about the connectedness of the local to the national and global scales. Even though the project is local, what implications does it have on a larger scale/what wider phenomenon is it influenced by? Ref. food justice, where community gardens and urban farms are emerging in cities which is in response to wider food and environmental trends like food deserts
