- Brings together four perspectives of "doing justice" in the waterfront area: ==economic justice, [[environmental justice]], social justice, tribal justice==. Each dimension comes with a its own challenges. The paper defines the scale of blue spaces as local and regional, and asks how waterfront revitalisation projects can address public trust, public spaces as common goods, and right to the city
	- This demonstrates that the challenge is to *"construct a place that works to counter established patterns of local and regional injustice"* (p. 764)
	- [[blue space]] is conceived as a *"shared public and environmental good"*, and is as important as green space, *"constituting their own species of urban space, whose urban political ecology is essential to the sustainable development of cities and urban regions"* (p. 765)
	- Seattle branded as a progressive and inclusionary place but still follows the pattern of high-growth, creative class, inequitable cities (p. 776)
	- *"In order to do justice on the waterfront, it may be more effective and efficient to identify the dynamics and outcomes that reinforce patterns of privilege and discrimination and proactively convene the leaders, groups and activists most impacted by such patterns and best poised to devise alternative paths forward"* (p. 776)
- Physical setting and built environment
	- Routes and connections: cars present a physical barrier between the city and waterfront, there are only disjointed and no unified pedestrian connections; haphazard parking
- Blue spaces as sustainable spaces: sustainability encompasses *"economic, environmental, social and cultural"* dimensions and blue spaces extends to all of them
	- Blue spaces as social spaces: *"of gathering, labour, economic exchange, recreation, subsistence fishing, cultural tradition and journey-making"* (p. 766)
	- Blue spaces as ecological spaces: *"of watershed catchment, primary productivity, near-shore habitat, species migration and environmental degradation"*
	- Blue space is ==permeable==, and isn't only the border of water with land (the waterfront). It encompasses the social (==shared #public-space==) and the environment

- Scale of blue spaces: local and regional governance; they need to be managed
	- *"Is the "public trust'' of the urban waterway as an environmental resource being protected as a ==common good==? Is the ==[[right to the city]]=='' of urban residents being enabled through waterfront land uses?''*
	- Tendency to favour *"established economic interests"* over grass-roots, community stakeholders

- Economic justice: entrepreneurial/neoliberal context makes it harder for local, small businesses and projects to take root; there's a need to protect affordable housing, empower local entrepreneurs, support minimum wage standards, divert from revenue intensive ideology
- Environmental justice: tendency for polluting industries to be located near ==low income/minority neighbourhoods==, and green revitalisation projects tend to be close to upper middle class neighbourhoods
	- To address [[environmental justice]], the waterfront should focus on *"the relative accessibility of the waterfront site to different populations; second, the relationship between the central waterfront and public investment in other Seattle shoreline sites; and finally, the quality of the environmental remediation that takes place"* (p. 771) $\rightarrow$ diversity of users; routes and connections;
	- ==[[accessibility]]==: site design, physical infrastructure, and the activities/behaviours they support; proximity by foot, bike, public transport, car; 
	- Considering the waterfront in a relationship to other waterfronts; not privileging already privileged areas (socio-economic situation) to the detriment or the ignorance of other spaces, which have more dire needs like making the space safe to use 
- Social justice: concern with social difference and inclusive democracy, highlights the concentration of social power amongst those with highest socio-economic status/the majority
	- ==[[social production of space]]==: a space is socially constructed and inhabited, *"it is through the social practices that become normalised in urban space, that the "right to the city" is exercised, produced and sustained"* (p. 773) $\rightarrow$ even if a space is physically accessible and public, those whose social practices and behaviours are different than that of the majority who use the space, will not feel welcome
	- ==Social practices of exclusion==: increasing privatisation of public space, encouraging consumption, spending money to fit in socially, excluding people based on socio-economic class, social relations are less public and thus less diversity of activities in the public realm; segregation by socio-economic means; women experiencing space different than men, feeling threatened
	- Tribal justice
