## notes

#### accessibility
- Quality of life in the city is associated to access to "nature and recreational opportunities"
- Park accessibility is closely linked to use patterns. Two factors:
	- **Distance** eg. people visit their local parks more than national parks which are further away (p. 54)
	- Size
- What is [[accessibility]]? *"the ease with which a site may be reached, providing a measure that evaluates the relative opportunity for contact or use"*  (p. 54)
	- Access was traditionally only about physical distance or proximity, and research emphasises the spatial-physical aspects of accessibility. 
		- Quantitative studies, distance to parks, park area per capita, number of parks
		- But this ignores the fact that...	
	- Accessibility is a [[multidimensionality|multidimensional]] and complex concept which cannot be reduced to the physical aspects only
		- Encompasses both the physical and non-physical, the geographic and social
	- Socio-personal aspects of accessibility: *"language and cultural barriers, gender ideologies, skills, information, and other socio-economic barriers"* (p. 54)

#### [[environmental justice]]
- Access is an important aspect of EJ, studies show that people of lower socio-economic status (SES) and POC have lower geographic access to green space, meaning they use them less
- *"environmental equity concerns"*
- But, in some cases, low SES and POC communities live in proximity to green space but do not use them often (Bristol, USA) --> because there are other reasons than proximity why people don't use a park
	- quality, diversity, size, socio-personal

#### non-physical accessibility
- *"The advantage of physical proximity to parks and green spaces may be offset by the quality, diversity , and size of the green spaces or by socio-personal characteristics including age, income, safety, and cultural concerns"*
- Accessibility is more closely correlated to self-reported use, rather than objective measures like distribution or availability of green space

## thesis


Research on accessibility of natural spaces has emphasised the physical aspect, such as proximity to green space, but accessibility is a multidimensional and complex concept which cannot be reduced to the spatial realm. There is a need for more research on the non-physical, social aspects of sustainability, that look at "language and cultural barriers, gender ideologies, skills, information, and other socio-economic barriers" (Wang).
Grappling with this concept, Wang (cite) extends the definition of accessibility to include perceived access to create a more comprehensive
