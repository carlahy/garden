- What are the potential health benefits of being near to, seeing, using blue spaces? The study looks are the perceived well-being of elderly in Hong-Kong
- The benefits of green spaces in urban environments are known. Dense, stressful, polluted urban environments can cause physical and mental illnesses, and green spaces can help reduce these symptoms. Three main ways in which green and health are linked (according to Markevych et al., (p. 100)):
	- *"Reducing environmental harms (eg. mitigating noise pollution)"* $\rightarrow$ environment
	- *"Supporting emotion regulation and the restoration of depleted cognitive capacities (eg. through stress alleviation)"* $\rightarrow$ social
	- *"Building capacities (eg. through supporting physical activity)"* $\rightarrow$ social
- Blue spaces provide similar benefits, like reducing stress, heart diseases, making people more physically active, etc. But to what extent do you need to frequent the blue spaces to gain these benefits? How much blue/green space is required in order to get the benefits
- Three research questions: (p. 101)
	- *"To what extent is self-reported general health and wellbeing in Hong Kong related to an individuals exposure to the city's blue spaces?"*
	- *"Which environmental factors predict blue space visit frequency in Hong Kong?"* They looked at the safety, presence of wildlife, clean/free from litter, and good facilities like footpaths or toilets
	- *"Are some visit and environmental characteristics associated with better short-term recalled wellbeing outcomes?"*
- The conclusion, indirect and intentional exposure were associated with good health and high level of wellbeing; good facilities and wildlife are related to intentional usage; safety and wildlife are related to higher levels of wellbeing and g when visiting the blue space; visible blue space from home is related to better perceived health; those who regularly visit/see from home blue spaces are more likely to have good mental health and good general health.

How will this paper be relevant for my thesis:

- $\Rightarrow$ This paper analyses the perceived health benefits that blue spaces can have on the population (it focuses on elderly residents). It defines three categories of blue space exposure: indirect (view from home), incidental (on commute route), and intentional (purposeful visit), and addresses different factors that could influence people's perception and use of the blue space, like safety, cleanliness, facilities, accessibility. They find a positive relation between blue space and overall wellbeing, including good health and good mental health.
- It recognises the particularities of Hong Kong: it is surrounded by water, has high quality and safe public space, a fantastic public transit system (which makes it easy for people to reach blue spaces if they don't live nearby). I think it is necessary to acknowledge these particularities in a city, because they can influence how people interact with blue (or green) spaces.
- Why is it relevant to me? It provides a categorisation of blue space usage, and a framework for analysing the benefits and quality of blue spaces. It focuses on the effect that blue spaces have on the physical wellbeing of people, and this falls under social sustainability.
