PGS = [[public green space]]

### notes
- Barriers or constraints previously identified in research:
	- Intrapersonal, interpersonal, and structural barriers*
		- Intrapersonal: psychological state, like lack of interest or meaningfulness in PGS visits, language barriers making it difficult to communicate with others, personal safety concerns, physical/health contraints, preferences for other activities
		- Interpersonal: relationships between individuals, no one to go with , not knowing other users, dificulty in mixing with others, too many male visitors
		- Structural: lack of accessible PGS, not having enough money, poor park management quality, having other options, lack of information, overcrowding, not wanting to disrupt daily routines, weater #observations
	- *Availability, accessibility, attractiveness*: a hierarchy, where the first have to be fulfilled for the latter to be unlocked 
		- Availability and accessibility focus on physical accessibility, and less on personal or social factors that could influence PGS use; and lack of research on the ladder, ie. attractiveness, and social/personal barriers
		- *Attractiveness* has both a physical and social dimension. Physical has been widely studied, so this paper focuses on social
- Previous studies (Seaman et al. 2010) have identified *categories shaping decisions* about PGS use:
	- availability of community resoruces,
	- lifestyle and lifestage factors,
	- individual values,
	- levels of experienced integration and inclusion by individuals in their communities
- Social elements as barriers to access:
	- Antisocial behaviour (litter, broken glass, vandalism) --> #observations 
- the aim of this research is to *"improve knowledge about self-perceived social barriers that prevent people from using available and accessible PGS"*, in order to increase PGS use by developing effective strategies. The focus will be on why and why not, people choose to use PGS. ==> "*what barriers related to the social environmnet prevent potential users to use available and accessible PGSs or that prevent them to use PGSs in an integral way?*"

### methods
 - most research uses [[quantitative]] research methods
 - [[qualitative]] research methodology, interviews with 51 users of PGS of diverse age, gendre, migration background, socioeconomic situation

### results
- identified 3 **[[social barriers]]** for the use of *available and accessible* PGS:
	- 1. perceived dangers due to bad precendents, the presence of socially frightnening elements, or a lack of social control
	- 2. not feeling in place because of the dominance of a specific group of users, or because of community perceptions
	- 3. not fulfilling one's social needs
- These **social barriers** manifested in different ways and changed the extent to which PGS were used. They are: barriers to going, to staying, and for *integral use* (ie. full or optimal use, see below) --> can evaluate integrality through #observations of UBS, maybe integrality across city? again justify why doing comparative research
- "Physical traces of social activities impact on the appearance of PGSs through litter, vandalism, and tags for instance, resulting in visual clues that are socially evaluated and interpreted". PGS are continuously socially evaluated, even if they are a physical space --> justifies using #observations as method to complement interviews 

#### [[integrality of use]]
- Dimensions of the **completeness or [[integrality of use]]**:
	- Spatial integrality: using all different parts of the PGS
	- Temporal integrality: using PGS at all times of day
	- Social integrality of PGS use: without any restrictions concerning social interaction
