## Notes
#### Urban greening interventions
- Cities employ urban greening internventions to address socio-environmental and health challenges
- Urban greening interventions: nature-based projects that provide green infrastructures or amenities like parks, greenbelts, green roofs...
- Greening projects supported by policies and research (eg. [[U.S. Envrionmental Protection Agency]], [[SDG]] 11, green branding ...) and are often unquestioned. It is assued that greening projects do not have any negative economic, ecological, social or health side effects (p. 2-3)
- BUT these measures seldom include the dimension of **equity**, and do not account for communities and residents who are *"historically vulnerable to envrionmental racism, displacement, or both. .... For the most part, there is an implicit assumption of "green" [[tricke down effects]] "* (p. 2)
- Greening as a tool for **capital accumulation** : branding cities *"liveable, healthy, environmentally attractive, and amenable for highly trained employees"* 
-  $\Rightarrow$ *"urban greening is a deeply political project grounded in technocratic principles and the naive apolitical assumption that greening will, unassisted, result in both more just and prosperous cities"*  (p. 3)

#### [[environmental justice|Green environmental injustices]]
 - *"green devaluation, rent gap, and new value creation... green disposession and accumulation, ... green exclusion and privilege,... and green gentrification and displacement ... - all of them recent manifestations of green environmental injustices"* (p. 3)
 - *"These processes of green environmental injustices illustrate (as other environmental injustices) a negative, disproportionate impact for minority and low-income residents"*
 
 #### DIMENSIONS of Justice
 - Literature tends to fit justice into three categories: distribution, recognition, participation. But the paper wants to focus on the "invisible and situated experiences and everyday practices" of green injustices
 - RQ: *"what new imaginations and practices are possible and necessary to advance just urban greening as a scholarly field and planning practice, and what is the role of academic scholarship in pursuing more equitable greening?"*

#### benefits of urban greening
- Economic development: green spaces make neighbourhoods more attractive which raises property value
- Ecological benefits: diversity of ecosystems, reduced air pollutions, carbon sequestration,...
- Health benefits:

#### new paradigms of justice 


## Thesis relevance
- This paper gives a summary of the negative side effects that urban greening interventions can have especially on vulnerable populations. It says that although greening projects are supported by organisations on the national and global scale, and pushed through policies and research schemes, it fails to address the dimension of equity (and thus, EV). It criticises the orthodox and positivist green discourse, and shows the limitations of the traditional dimensions of justice (distributional, recognitional, procedural)
- 
- Urban greening $\rightarrow$ urban blueing 
- Green environmental injustices $\rightarrow$ blue environmental injustices
- Should I try to look for signs of inequity in my research? What is my approach to EV?
