## notes
### urban greening interventions
- Cities employ urban greening internventions to address socio-environmental and health challenges
- Urban greening interventions: nature-based projects that provide green infrastructures or amenities like parks, greenbelts, green roofs...
- Greening projects supported by policies and research (eg. [[U.S. Envrionmental Protection Agency]], [[SDG]] 11, green branding ...) and are often unquestioned. It is assued that greening projects do not have any negative economic, ecological, social or health side effects (p. 2-3)
- BUT these measures seldom include the dimension of **equity**, and do not account for communities and residents who are *"historically vulnerable to envrionmental racism, displacement, or both. .... For the most part, there is an implicit assumption of "green" [[tricke down effects]] "* (p. 2)
- Greening as a tool for **capital accumulation** : branding cities *"liveable, healthy, environmentally attractive, and amenable for highly trained employees"* 
-  $\Rightarrow$ *"urban greening is a deeply political project grounded in technocratic principles and the naive apolitical assumption that greening will, unassisted, result in both more just and prosperous cities"*  (p. 3)

### [[environmental justice|green environmental injustices]]
 - *"green devaluation, rent gap, and new value creation... green disposession and accumulation, ... green exclusion and privilege,... and green gentrification and displacement ... - all of them recent manifestations of green environmental injustices"* (p. 3)
 - *"These processes of green environmental injustices illustrate (as other environmental injustices) a negative, disproportionate impact for minority and low-income residents"*

### benefits of urban greening
- Economic development: green spaces make neighbourhoods more attractive which raises property value
- Ecological benefits: diversity of ecosystems, reduced air pollutions, carbon sequestration,...
- Health benefits: perceived wellbeing, etc.

 ### justice
 
 #### traditional dimensions of justice
 - Literature tends to fit justice into three categories: **distribution, recognition, participatory/procedural**. But the paper wants to focus on the *"invisible and situated experiences and everyday practices"* of green injustices
 - Need to ADVANCE the concept of justice
 - RQ $\Rightarrow$ *"what new imaginations and practices are possible and necessary to advance just urban greening as a scholarly field and planning practice, and what is the role of academic scholarship in pursuing more equitable greening?"*
 - **Limits** of traditional dimensions of justice: 
	 - Don't acknowledge socio-spatial inequalities, and are wrapped up in the benefits. Need to identify the injustices and how they manifest
	 - **Distributional justice**: the siting of green interventions can exacerbate green gentrification; *"whether those interventions avoid displacement and new negative green, ecological, climate and health effects"* (p. 6); traditionally, green spaces are of lower quality in poor neighbourhoods compared to wealthier neighbourhoods
	 - **Recognition justice**: *"lack of attention to the distinct values, identities, needs and preferences that certain social groups assign to greening"*; lack of understanding of people's/communities' experiences of a space; privileging flashy green interventions that satisfy investors rather than needs of (vulnerable) residents; *"risks creating sociocultural invisibilisation and silencing minority socionatures"*; need to understand how different social groups *"attach and artifulate values, preferences and needs regarding urban nature and ecosystem services"*
	 - **Procedural justice**: *"questions of inclusion and exclusion in participation and decision making"*; more on the side of design and planning; even with ideal participation, there is the possibility that spaces of environmental refuge, eg. community gardens, are captured by gentrifiers

#### expanding boundaries of justice
Two analytical goals:
- **Uncovering material and immaterial power**
	- In planning, the material are the physical green infrastructures, and immaterial are the exposed urban green visions, projections, discourses;
	- Hegemonic green planning practices sell green/sustainable/smart/resilient narratives, but the vulnerable are often excluded; only sees benefits of greening and none of the shortfalls
	- Who is the space for? Who are the vision for? Who are planners, and the city, attracting/targeting?
	
- **Advancing new principles for equity in urban greening**
	- New principles to capture (in)justices in urban greening. These are:
		- **Emancipatory and antisubordination greening**
			- Requires acknolwedgement of inequalities (emphasis on racism, "whiteness as a spatial practice of domination and subordination", white supremacy), and systematic and asymmetrical structures of power and domination
			- Understanding unconsciousness bias, discrimination, in planning and development
			- Green injustices reproduced in neighbourhoods under green capital and neoliberal paradigms
			- Emancipatory liberating spaces (and imaginations): spaces in which marginalised groups can thrive
			- Reparative and restorfative justice, green reparations
			- Preventive justice, preventing future harms
		- **Intersectional greening**:
			- Understanding *"how people (1) understand, sense and live in spaces having multiple, concurring identities in place while being exposed to multipal environmental inequalities, injustices and insecurities and (2) interpret them in different historic moments"* $\rightarrow$ different identities of immigrants, for eg.
			- Peoples sense of place ([[PPGIS]]!)
			- [[subaltern urbanism|subaltern epistemologies]] (p. 12)
			- "Protecting spaces that serve as refuge for non-dominant groups", [[right to the city|right to inhabit space]] 
		- **Relational greening**: 
			- Borrowed from feminism
			- *"Calling for the examination of connections among sites, scales and subjectivities to highlight "everyday life" that takes into account homes, plazas, neighbourhoods and workplaces and the possibilty of challenging silces and violence, racialisation, classism, and patriarchy in ways that politicise and rehumanise place-life relationships"*
			- Paying attention to the ways minorities disappear in a heteronormative, sexist, racist society

### research questions for critical envrionmental justice
- ***"how do people's experiences of place shape their perception of access?"***
	- how history, race, domination, power dynamics inhibit people's ability from emancipating; "how historical pervasive inequalities, relations of domination and historical, ongoing experiences of place complicate a sense of space and therefore access to green space and amenities"
	- *"new green amenities and spaces might not be seen as integrated, welcoming and convivial amenities for minorities or immigrants, especially so when minorities are or were exposed to racist (immatieral) discourses and (material) practicies about who and what nature is"* $\rightarrow$ could this be the case in my case study?  how to tell if a space is inclusive etc. (how to measure inclusivity/access, ref. above)?
	- [[justice#hermeneutical justice|hermeneutical injustice]] 
	- [[justice#epistemic justice|epsitemic justice]]
	- [[PPGIS]]! "specific community-based participatory research processes, such as PPGIS, might uncover local spatial knowledge and perceptions"
		- other community participatory methods: PhotoVoice

- ***"how is access measured?"***
	- intersectionality and relationality are key for measurement
	- "Combining equity (addressing existing sociospatial unevenness in green space access) with an equality-based approach to greening (developing widespread, universal greening interventions through the urban space) can inform analytical approaches to access while also considering spatial and temporal imbalances as shifting realities"
	- consider how (racial) minorities can be excluded politically, socially, culturally, physically

- ~~***"who pays for and maintains new "accessible" green space?"***~~
	- how they're financed, unequal distribution of resources and investments accross the city #distributional-justice
	- lack of political and individual power in minorities; lack of money, time, ability or desire from residents to maintain green spaces

- ***"whose uses and needs are protected or sacrificed in order to create new access?"***
	- green spaces embody gender-bias and patriarchal imaginations, rather than feminist and geographically sensitive ones

- ~~***"to what extent does urban greening address past history and trauma and avoid new risk?"***~~
	- 



#### new paradigms of justice 
- Intersectional and multi-dimensional aspects of space: achieved when spaces support a diversity of users and uses, eg. *"when play spaces become community gathering spaces, sites for climate mitigation, or safe spaces for women and children"* (p. 18)


## Thesis relevance
- This paper gives a summary of the negative side effects that urban greening interventions can have especially on vulnerable populations. It says that although greening projects are supported by organisations on the national and global scale, and pushed through policies and research schemes, it fails to address the dimension of equity (and thus, EV). It criticises the orthodox and ==positivist== green discourse, and shows the limitations of the traditional dimensions of justice (distributional, recognitional, procedural)
- 
- Urban greening $\rightarrow$ urban blueing 
- Green environmental injustices $\rightarrow$ blue environmental injustices
- Should I try to look for signs of inequity in my research? What is my approach to EV?
- Subaltern urbanisms?

#### ideas for research questions
**Based on rqs proposed by the paper**
- To what extent are Copenhagen's waterfront redevelopment projects spaces of *emancipation and liberation* for all residents, thereby contributing to envrionmental justice in the city?
	- *"Liberatory spatial justice imaginations"* (p. 11)
- How do people's experience of <Copenhagen's waterfronts> shape their perception of access? ( #todo  explain how this relates to environmental justice)
- Whose uses and needs are protected or sacrificed in order to create new access?
